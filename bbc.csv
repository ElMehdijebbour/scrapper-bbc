', ['According to his family, Mr Chavez passed out inside his truck in the early afternoon. They later told local media he had remained there unnoticed for at least 20 minutes before help was called. He was later pronounced dead. ', 'While the investigation into his death is ongoing, his family believes they know the cause: heatstroke, brought on by a record-breaking heatwave that is ongoing across the US. ', 'Faced with increasingly dangerous and sometimes fatal temperatures, nearby Los Angeles is among the cities that is considering naming heatwaves - like storms - in a bid to raise public awareness of the dangers and help local officials roll out measures to mitigate the impact of extreme heat, such as opening air-conditioned shelters or activating a ""heat action plan"". ', 'Advocates of the system believe it could save lives amid fears that human-induced climate change makes heatwaves more frequent, more intense and longer lasting. ', 'Another US city - Miami - has already named May to October as a ""heat season"", which could include named heatwaves - the same system is used for the hurricanes that reach its shores. ', '""This will be the season where we are on alert just as we are for hurricanes,"" Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said at the COP26 climate conference in Scotland last year.  ""We want to develop that same level of awareness and preparedness.""', '""[People] don\'t realise the danger of heat and how it\'s getting harmer,"" she added. ""We have to break through some inertia from complacency to help people understand the seriousness.""', 'About 600 Americans die of heat-related illnesses each year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ', 'This year alone, record temperatures across the country are believed to be responsible for a string of recent deaths, including that of a police officer in Louisiana, an archaeologist working in a nature park and a former NFL star in Texas. ', 'The true figure is probably higher, experts warn, with some studies placing the death toll at 12,000 each year. The number is expected to rise as the severity of heatwaves worsens in the future. ', '""It\'s inevitable,"" Dr Robert Hughes, an emergency medicine physician and assistant professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC.', '""Seeing heatwaves more frequently is going to lead to more exposure in an unready and ill-prepared population,"" he added. ""As climate change worsens, we\'re going to see increased illness."" ', 'Forecasts point to mounting health risks as a result of extreme heat. In California, for example, the state\'s department of insurance predicted that Los Angeles will see as many as 22 ""extreme heat days"" each year by 2050, up from an average of just six between 1998 and 2000. ', 'In 2020 alone, state officials found that emergency room visits rose tenfold during a heatwave that saw temperatures spike to highs of 49C (121F). ', ""Professor Kristie Ebi, an expert in the health risks of climate variability at the University of Washington's Center for Health and the Global Environment, said that while such extreme temperatures can be fatal, the vast majority of heat-related deaths are preventable. "", '""Nobody needs to die in a heatwave,"" she said. ""If we have effective early warning and response systems and adjust our infrastructure so that we live in cities that are prepared for warmer temperatures, we won\'t have so many people dying in the heat."" ', 'Among the potential solutions that have been proposed is the naming and categorising of heatwaves.', ""Under the proposed system - first suggested by the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center - heatwaves would be named and categorised on a scale of one to three, taking into account factors including the heat index, night-time temperatures and the increase in temperature over the past 30 days."", ""Each city's scale is tailored to its particular climate and would vary between regions. "", ""In practice, this would mean that while a 38C (100F) day would be as hot in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as it is in Phoenix, Arizona, Milwaukee's residents would be less prepared for it - and potentially in greater danger. "", 'In late June, the Spanish city of Seville became the world\'s first to adopt the system. The first named heatwave - Zoe - ""arrived"" on 25 July, bringing with it temperatures of 43C (109F). The heatwave was considered a ""category 3"" - the most severe in the system.', 'A series of other category 3 heatwaves - Yago, Xenia, Wenceslao and Vega - are expected later this summer. Each will trigger measures that could include welfare checks on elderly residents or the opening of community pools. ', 'Four US cities - Miami, Los Angeles, Kansas City and Minneapolis - are currently testing similar systems.', 'Kathy Baughman McLeod, an expert in climate change solutions at the Atlantic Council, said that the system could help ""build a culture of preparation and prevention"" to combat a threat that isn\'t as ""visually engaging"" as a hurricane. ', '""Heat is not dramatic. It doesn\'t rip the roof off of your house and you don\'t have cars floating down flooded streets. Heatwaves are pervasive and they\'re sneaky,"" she told the BBC. ""It\'s silent and invisible, and it needs PR - a name and a brand."" ', 'As an example, Ms McLeod said that naming a heatwave could help encourage people to take essential steps to keep themselves and family members safe, such as stocking up on water and making sure children and elderly relatives are keeping cool. ', '""With a name, hashtag and the media, we think [a named heatwave] sends a message that this is serious, and that you need to act to protect yourself,"" she added. ', 'Not everyone is convinced that the system would work. Ms Ebi, for example, said there\'s a lack of evidence that naming inclement weather events - even hurricanes - changes people\'s perception, and that the system might not be able to handle the ""complexity"" of heatwaves that span the US. ', '""What happens in cases like right now, where heatwaves cover multiple locations, with multiple thresholds, and start on different days?"" she asked. ""And we don\'t have good research that putting a name on it makes a difference. We just don\'t have that evidence.""', '""Yes, we do need to increase awareness,"" she added. ""But at this moment it\'s not clear that naming heatwaves would be the way to do that."" ', 'Solutions such as naming heatwaves or taking steps to fight climate change, doctors warn, are long-term projects that are unlikely to bear fruit for decades - even if they are adopted. ', 'In the short-term, physicians say that the best strategy remains being aware of the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke and taking steps to protect those who are particularly vulnerable. ', '""That includes staying hydrated, frequent breaks, finding shade and checking in on loved ones, and making sure you have adequate cooling mechanisms, such as fans,"" Dr Hughes said. ""These things all become exceedingly important to try and mitigate those downstream effects.""

It affects neurons in a specific area of the brain called the substantia nigra. "", 'It is degenerative, gradually leading to tremors and stiffness in the limbs. Global studies show rural, agricultural areas often have higher rates of the disease.', 'Julie explains her childhood farm was owned by the local council, so her father had to meet certain conditions.

"", 'Earlier that day, gale-force winds and heavy rains had delayed sailing for the final leg of the cruise towards Durban several times. But with no sign of conditions improving, the captain eventually decided to lift anchor and the Oceanos, with 581 guests and crew on board, sailed off into 40-knot winds and 9m-high (30ft) waves.

They didn't know how to keep them steady as people got on, so Moss improvised by standing with one leg on the deck of the ship and the other on a lifeboat. "", ""But each time the ship rolled to starboard, Moss would have to jump back onto the Oceanos before the lifeboat swung away, opening up a gap of a couple of metres, and then swung back, smashing with such force against the ship's hull that bits of it came splintering off."", 'Each heaving lifeboat, now with as many as 90 people in it, many screaming in fear, would then be lowered down to the sea on cables. But Moss had no idea how to start the engines or even where the keys were.', '""We\'d let them go, off into the night, and they would just drift away into the pounding waves,"" he says. ""The people in the lifeboats had a torturous time - they were getting deluged in spray, it was cold and completely dark, but we just had to carry on until all of the starboard side lifeboats were launched.""', 'By now the Oceanos was taking in more and more water and heeling markedly to its starboard side. Launching the remaining lifeboats on the port side safely was near impossible.', 'Instead of being lowered down to the water once loaded up with people, the lifeboats would cling to the side of the ship until the next big wave rolled in, tipping the ship enough to let them dangle freely.', '""And then gravity would suddenly drop the lifeboat three or four metres (13 ft) in one go, almost tipping people out into the open water, it was horrific,"" Moss says.', 'Eventually, he realised it was too dangerous to continue.  ', '""In the effort to try and rescue people we were possibly going to kill them,"" Moss says.', 'And time was running out.', ""Unable to launch any more lifeboats, but with hundreds of people still in need of rescue, Moss and others made their way up to the ship's bridge - where they assumed they would find the captain and the remaining senior officers - to ask what to do next."", '""We looked inside, but there was no one there,"" Moss says.

""I was making regular checks to see where the water level was, and one deck below us was flooded.""', 'Eventually, Moss found the captain, right at the back of the ship, smoking in the darkness. Moss explained that they needed his help - urgently.', '""He was just looking at me, wide-eyed and vacant, saying, \'It\'s not necessary, it\'s not necessary,\'"" Moss says.', '""I think he was in deep, deep shock.""', ""The two ships close to the Oceanos had only one lifeboat each, so there was little they could do to help. They shared the sinking vessel's coordinates with the South African authorities who began to organise an air rescue mission.

They said they needed help to get everyone off before the ship sank, and Moss was given a five-minute crash course on how to run a helicopter airlift."", '""Remember, the harness needs to be quite tight under people\'s underarms,"" the navy diver told him. ""Make sure you get it right because otherwise they\'ll tip upside down and fall out - you\'ll kill them on the deck. Do two at a time or else we\'re going to run out of time. OK? Go.""', 'One navy diver went to organise the helicopter rescue at the rear of the ship and Tracy and Moss were to organise a second at the front.

', 'Dangling in mid-air from the helicopter cable, people who Moss was trying to save were being blown against parts of the ship by the strong winds as they were winched into the sky. There was no way of knowing how badly hurt they were and Moss momentarily lost his nerve.

To help achieve that goal, Ms Grimm wants the nation to ""ramp-up"" its use of hydrogen.', 'Hydrogen can store vast amounts of energy, replace natural gas in industrial processes, and power fuel cells in trucks, trains, ships or planes that emit nothing but vapour of drinkable water.', ""Ms Grimm's enthusiasm is gaining traction, "", ' (IEA), an energy research group, dozens of countries have published national hydrogen strategies, or are about to.', ""Despite this flurry of interest, it's not clear yet that the large-scale use of hydrogen can be made viable."", ""After all, there has been similar excitement before: in the 1970s, after two oil crises, and in the 1990s, when climate worries arose. But both petered out. So, is today's hype any different?"", 'Sceptics warn that industry representatives, who globally dominate most hydrogen councils, are often biased in favour of hydrogen as it promises subsidies and keeps up demand for existing assets such as pipelines, tankers, turbines or boilers. ', 'They also ', ' big, green-sounding plans for a more distant future rather than more difficult solutions. ', 'Meanwhile, environmental groups are cautious, they point out that hydrogen cannot be harvested as a primary fuel. Instead, it has to be made, mainly in two ways, each marked by a colour code.', ' by using electricity from renewable power to split water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules using an electrolyser. But those machines and the electricity to run them remain costly.', 'These costs means that, at the moment, such emission-free hydrogen makes up only 0.03% of global hydrogen production, according to the IEA.', 'Up to five times cheaper is so-called grey hydrogen, this is derived from natural gas, or in some cases from oil or coal. But due to losses during production, about 50% more CO2 is emitted than if natural gas were directly burned.', 'A related technique is known as blue hydrogen. This relies on the same process, but captures about 60-90% of the carbon emitted in production for re-use or storage.', 'The drawback with this method is that it roughly doubles the cost and lacks production facilities at large scale. So only 0.7% of globally-produced hydrogen is blue.', 'So, despite its environmentally-friendly image and potential, the global production of hydrogen currently emits almost three times as much CO2 as a whole country, France, for instance.', 'Much then will hinges on how countries decide to produce hydrogen.', 'Some countries already have a clear priority - to power electrolysers most sun-baked nations bet on solar power, while France relies on nuclear energy.', 'China meanwhile cherishes cheap grey hydrogen from coal and gas and invests in green alternatives.', 'The US, Canada, UK, Netherlands and Norway are leading the push for blue hydrogen, by injecting captured carbon into oil and gas fields for long-term storage, or for so-called enhanced oil recovery that boosts extraction.', 'In Germany, however, the picture is less clear. ', 'Volker Quaschning, professor for renewable energy systems at Berlin\'s University of Applied Sciences and criticises Germany\'s hydrogen strategy: ""Merkel\'s government used it as a red herring to conceal its own failures in the energy transition.""', ""He argues that solar and wind power should have been expanded faster to facilitate future green hydrogen production - a step that Germany's new government has promised to take."", 'However, on hydrogen the three parties in the governing coalition, the three responsible ministries, and the hydrogen council all internally argue whether to concentrate on green hydrogen, or to accept the blue alternative, to temporarily bridge the gap in limited supply. ', 'Ms Grimm represents the majority view on the hydrogen council in favouring a multi-colour mix.', '""Accepting blue hydrogen will help create the supply that we need for a budding industry,"" she argues. ""It will foster technological breakthroughs in Germany and encourage potential suppliers to invest in green hydrogen production.""', 'In January, Economy Minister Robert Habeck announced an ambitious push for renewables and a doubling of the two-year old target for domestic production capacity of green hydrogen to rise by a factor of 150 from 70 MW today to 10 GW by 2030.

', 'Mr Habeck is frantically visiting energy exporters. Within one week in March, he travelled to Norway to agree on a feasibility study for the construction of a hydrogen pipeline, went to Qatar to finalise an energy partnership and visited the United Arab Emirates to sign five cooperation agreements.', 'The first deliveries from the UAE are expected to arrive later this year.', ""Other countries on Mr Habeck's hydrogen radar are Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Chile, Namibia and Australia."", 'Though he acknowledges the need to import hydrogen, Mr Quaschning dashes some of Mr Habeck\'s hopes. ""Importing hydrogen from desert plants will be sluggish, inefficient and expensive,"" he explains.', 'Each step in the supply chain uses up some of the original energy: desalinating sea water to get fresh water as raw material, electrolysis, liquification for shipping, transport via tanker, local transport via pipeline in Germany and re-conversion of hydrogen into electricity.', '""Together, these steps would eat up at least 70% of the electricity originally produced in the desert,"" Mr Quaschning says.', '""So, even though a solar panel in the desert produces 80% more electricity than one in Germany, the losses on the way are so big, that it would be twice as effective to directly produce solar power in Germany.""', 'Due to its high-cost, hydrogen is often referred to as the champagne of the energy transition. So, who will get the first sips?', 'On this, most observers agree. ""It is crucial that we allocate hydrogen only to those industries, where direct electrification is not possible"", explains Felix Matthes energy expert at Öko-Institut, a think tank, and member of Germany\'s hydrogen council.', '""So, we should first use it in the production of steel, chemicals and glass,"" he argues.', 'Subsequent sectors could be shipping, long distance truck transport, as well as planes for medium or long distances. Other uses in cars or heating are inefficient, costly and impractical distractions, he adds.', '""Plus, Mr Habeck\'s new push for renewables will create a greater need to balance our electricity supply, which hydrogen could do with electrolysers producing hydrogen on sunny, windy days as large-scale storage for cloudy winter days,"" Mr Matthes says.', 'The pressure is on Germany to stop spending so much on Russian energy, but it will be a tricky process.', 'Many will be hoping that hydrogen eases that transition by fulfilling its promise this time around.']]","(['Germany', 'Renewable energy', 'Solar power', 'Climate change'],)","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/18AF/production/_124691360_gettyimages-1239837687.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12637/production/_124691357_gettyimages-1236600812.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15A3/production/_124693550_gettyimages-1338388867.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/157E9/production/_124814088_green_hydrogen_explainer--2x-nc.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/66CF/production/_124691362_gettyimages-1238686056.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8911/production/_122398053_gettyimages-962596192.jpg",By Janek Schmidt,2022-05-24 10:45:43+00:00

Inspired by her brother, she decided to follow a completely different career path and become a wedding celebrant.', ['She discusses the challenges of taking on an entirely new job in your fifties, for our business advice series CEO Secrets.', ""I loved teaching, working with kids and changing lives. It was very rewarding but towards the end of my career I was a bit disenchanted. I grew tired of the bureaucracy and box-ticking and felt the creativity had gone. Sometimes I used to look out the window in the classroom and watch the cars go past, wondering what other people are doing. I was thinking: 'There's a whole world out there, and I've been doing this for so long'. "", 'I confessed this to my brother, who was quite a free-spirit of the seventies. He said: ""Amanda, you can do it, you know there\'s lots of skills that you\'ve got that people don\'t have.""', ""The thing that triggered the change for me was my brother's death: it was my first real bereavement. I'd been doing things on autopilot, like clearing his flat, keeping myself distracted and people thought I was coping very well. But I was absolutely dreading the funeral. "", ""My dad suggested we have a celebration, with a celebrant conducting the ceremony. I'd never heard of that role before. "", ""Preparing the eulogy I got to know the celebrant and got on well with him. He was very supportive and down to earth. The ceremony was amazing. Suddenly I thought I'd like to do that for other people. It was an impulse and it was like my brother's legacy to me."", ""My most recent wedding was a pirate-themed ceremony at a marina in Harlow, Essex. It took me out of my comfort zone. The couple loved sailing. I had to ham it up and I don't normally even like dressing-up parties. "", ""I was nervous at first, which doesn't usually happen to me, but then I found myself really getting into it and loved it. They'd made a stage for me on the prow of the boat. When I was rehearsing for that one, my neighbours must have thought I was mad!"", ""I've done weddings, funerals and vow renewals, but the majority of my work is weddings."", ""Most of the weddings I do are more traditional. I don't judge. I just help the couples achieve the personalised ceremony they want. I meet the couples several weeks or even months before the event to get to know them and start planning things. I also officiate at the ceremony."", ' who want a personalised, non-religious ceremony - people renewing their vows, or people who are marrying from two different faiths. In England and Wales a registrar still needs to officiate during part of the wedding, for it to be legally binding. This element is usually performed separately.', 'The one thing you might not realise is all the transferable skills you have - your employer might not even appreciate them. ', ""In my case from teaching it was public speaking, practised in school assemblies standing in front of 300 teenagers every week. I also had people and project management skills, and the ability to listen - actively rather than passively - through the pastoral roles I had at school, or parents' evenings. "", 'But with teaching every hour, every holiday was dictated, every deadline was set by someone else. Now I have to be self-disciplined.', ""I'm making a bit of money through the business, though not much yet. "", ""I suppose in some ways it was a blessing in disguise, since you couldn't do weddings at first - it gave me time to network, build up my contacts and lay the groundwork for my new business. I've done 15 weddings so far, and have 15 more booked-in. There is a big backlog now since restrictions have lifted, so there is work out there."", ""First of all, I don't act my age. I kayak, I'm into electronic dance music and I go to music festivals."", ""You might think people will be ageist when you start a business and you are over 50. And people do say, 'Oh, that's crazy, that's incredible!' But actually, people are really curious to find out your story, your journey and why you started a business. There are very supportive people out there who just want to guide and help you."", 'When you start a business in retirement, you might be surprised, but in fact one of the things you need to think about is managing your energy. You wake up every morning just buzzing and have lots of adrenalin and are learning new things, getting a new lease of life. But you have to manage your emotions. Not every day brings good things. ', 'But I love this job, every minute and every aspect of it, from meeting the couples to the creative side of researching and writing the material for the ceremonies. ', ""I stay in touch with all the couples and they are all special to me.

', 'Powered by nuclear reactors, these vessels could travel to islands, or coastlines, struck by drought, bringing with them both clean drinking water and power.', '""You could have them moving around on an intermittent basis, filling up tanks,"" says Mikal Bøe, chief executive of Core Power, which has come up with design for this type of desalination plant.

The majority are located in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, with others in countries including the UK, China, the US, Brazil, South Africa and Australia, to name a few.

The nuclear reactor would then lie at the heart of this vessel providing the huge amount of power needed. ', ""The firm's floating nuclear desalination vessels could have varying levels of power output, from five megawatts, up to around 70, Mr Bøe adds. At five megawatts of nuclear power, it could pump out 35,000 cubic metres - or 14 Olympic swimming pools' worth - of freshwater every day. "", 'To take the salt out of saltwater, desalination technology pushes treated seawater across a semi-permeable membrane at pressure. Osmosis, the movement of molecules in liquid across such membranes, removes the minerals, leaving freshwater and a separate, particularly salty water called brine.', 'There are different versions of this technology and it has become increasingly more efficient over the years. But floating desalination systems remain relatively rare.', 'Saudi Arabia, however, has just taken delivery of the first of ', '. So, can floating desalination plants take-off?', 'Oisann Engineering, which has developed a system called Waterfountain, hopes so.', 'The company has various designs, from large ships to small buoys, but they all work on the same principle, explains chief administrative officer, Kyle Hopkins.', ""However, the big difference is that instead of using nuclear power, they would all use what's called subsea desalination, a decades-old technology. "", '""[The technology] was never commercialised because you still need subsea pumps to facilitate taking the water to the surface,"" says Mr Hopkins. ""We removed the pump.""', 'He declines to elaborate as to how this works, beyond saying that the Waterfountain system as a whole takes advantage of the higher pressure on the seafloor to move water around, without incurring high energy costs.', ""He also mentions that the pipeline from the vessel to shore, where the freshwater must ultimately go, could be raised so that gravity can further assist the water's flow, too, cutting the need for extra power."", 'Mr Hopkins estimates that the technology could be, roughly, 30% more energy efficient than a traditional onshore desalination facility. The firm is currently building a miniature version of one of its designs and hopes to establish its first commercial installation in the Philippines in 2023.', 'Ideas such as this, and Core Power\'s design are ""promising"", says Raya Al-Dadah, head of the Sustainable Energy Technology Laboratory at the University of Birmingham. However, floating desalination has both advantages and disadvantages, she says. There are still challenges in terms of pumping the desalinated water ashore and in finding a workforce with both offshore experience and desalination expertise.', 'Ultimately, humanity needs more water resources, says Dr Al-Dadah, not least because of the expected effects of climate change, should the world experience more than 1.5C of warming. ""This will have a catastrophic impact on water,"" she says.', 'Referring to onshore systems, Amy Childress, at the University of Southern California, says that smaller desalination systems could help reduce the environmental impact of the technology. ', ""The highly salty water left after desalination is toxic to marine life and today's desalination facilities produce huge quantities of it -"", '. ', 'Mr Hopkins says that the byproduct expected from the Waterfountain system will not be salty enough to be classed as brine.', 'The most significant application of floating desalination systems could be in disaster relief, says Greg Pierce, co-director of the University of California Los Angeles Luskin Center for Innovation. ', 'Currently ""we\'re flying and trucking-in bottled water… it\'s the most inefficient thing possible,"" he explains, referring to the standard approach to relief efforts. ""If floating desalination can address that, I\'m all for that.""', 'However, Dr Pierce questions whether it can be made cost-effective enough in other contexts - and notes that there are many other ways of securing clean water supplies. In California, for example, Dr Pierce estimates better water conservation measures could conserve about 30-40% of the water currently consumed in the state. ', 'Communities will probably also turn to measures such as water recycling or treatment of rainwater. But should this still not suffice, desalination, no matter the expense, begins to look inevitable in some parts of the world, he adds. ', ""For now, Core Power's design is merely that, a design.

', '""Through this [system] you stop all activity in the flowers that, as a result, go into dormancy,"" Ms Kimani says, explaining that the flowers are put to sleep.', 'A sophisticated tracking system allows staff from the shipping company to monitor the temperature, oxygen and CO2 levels throughout the journey.', 'But flowers destined for such a long voyage need extra attention to prepare them, as soon as they are picked.', '""We harvest them early in the morning, when it\'s still cool and they will be the first to go into the cold room,"" explains Linda Murungi from grower, Sian Flowers.', 'Freshly-harvested roses, for instance, are then dipped into a chemical mixture to protect them from the fungus, botrytis.', 'After that, the stems are put into buckets to absorb a hydration solution so they can survive the thirty days without water. They are also put in a solution that curbs the growth hormone, ethylene, which causes the ageing of the flowers.', ""Once that process is completed, the flowers are then packed into cartons with holes in the top and bottom, which allow air from the container's system to circulate."", ""Kenya has become one of the world's biggest flower exporters thanks to its equatorial location, high altitudes and relatively cheap labour, it competes for dominance in the market with Colombia and Ecuador."", 'For years, the two Latin American countries have been exporting about 10% of their flowers by sea freight to North America and Europe.', 'As these flowers are at sea for a much shorter period of time, firms exporting from Latin America do not use controlled atmosphere, or post-harvest treatments.

There is no direct shipping route in to Europe, instead, containers are transferred in the Middle East from smaller vessels to much larger ones.', '""All processes around sea freight require extreme precision - there\'s no room for shortcuts,"" says Jeroen van der Hulst, chief executive at consulting company, FlowerWatch. ""One mistake and your flowers might arrive as compost in Europe.""

""It [eventually] arrived in the Netherlands after 53 days.

""With sea freight, however, our flowers are continuously in dormancy.""', 'The logistics of moving these flowers is not a simple decision, as prices are constantly changing. Shipping prices have also been rising closer to air freight costs.', 'But in the longer term, Mr Moster forecasts sea freight will account for at least 20% of Kenyan flower exports - a sector worth  $934m per year.', '""Air freight prices probably will never fall back to the level of before the Covid-19 crisis, so also from a cost perspective sea freight remains interesting,"" Mr Moster says.']]","(['Shipping industry', 'Kenya', 'Flowers'],)","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2BF7/production/_125555211_packingcoldstore_01.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1608F/production/_125555209_loadingcontainer_04.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/52A3/production/_125555112_flowerdipping_04.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4B9B/production/_125555391_staff_03.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/135FB/production/_125555397_truck_03.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EF47/production/_125555216_staff_02.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EEE3/production/_125555116_flowers_02.jpg",By Andrea Dijkstra,2022-06-30 23:01:04+00:00

She never considered using peat. Traditionally, peat fires were used to dry malted barley. "", '""Extracting peat to burn is not sustainable. Peatlands are created over a very long time. They are a great carbon sink and house enormous biodiversity,"" she says. ""When cut and burned, it impacts both the biodiversity of the peat bog and releases carbon back into the atmosphere.""', ""However, Ms Thomas agrees using peat does make a big difference to the taste of whisky - but it's not to everyone's liking."", '""You can taste it immediately,"" she says. ""It tastes smoky, some say like TCP!"" ', 'Ms Thomas prefers her whiskies un-peated, so it was not a difficult decision for her to cut it out of the process entirely.', '""There is a misconception that all Scotch is peated but there are many unpeated whiskies from Scotland,"" she says.', 'Whisky - made from fermented, often malted, grain such as rye, wheat, corn or barley - has been distilled in Scotland for hundreds of years.', 'In peated whiskies, malt grain is spread out over a perforated floor and underneath peat is burned, producing wafts of flavoursome smoke.', ""Whisky is made all over the world, and it's not just in Scotland that peat is considered a vital component.

It\'s what drives my experimentation in the distillery.""', 'Belgrove uses biofuel made from waste chip shop cooking oil. They grow their own grain and, at the end of the process, the spent mash is fed to the sheep. ', 'Using peat from the family farm, Mr Bignell employs several unusual peating techniques in a bid to get more out of this precious resource.', '""Much of the smoking is done in a modified industrial clothes dryer,"" he says. ""I malt the grain in it, then smoke the green malt without moving it to another vessel."" ', 'The wet grain tumbles through the smoke, he explains, and to increase the smoke level he often re-wets it. ', '""Re-wetting the grain part way through the process produces much more smoke,"" he says.', 'Mr Bignell also crushes dry malted grain and dampens it. Smoke is then passed up through the damp grain bed.', '""Crushing the grain first means it absorbs a lot more smoke from the same amount of peat."" ', 'Another technique Mr Bignell uses is to smoke the inside of a barrel before filling it with spirit. ', '""A lot of smoke is lost during fermentation and distillation. By smoking a wet barrel, I found much more is retained than when you pass it through a still. Though, it results in a very different taste profile,"" he comments.', 'Mr Bignell has also found a way to eliminate the use of peat completely - by burning sheep dung readily available on his farm.', 'Peatlands are naturally wet ecosystems.', 'In these water-saturated soils, there is little oxygen available for the microbes that breakdown organic materials, so decomposition happens very slowly. ', ' recovered from peat bogs thousands of years after they were buried.', ""This lack of decomposition means that the carbon contained in all the plant and animal matter that makes up the peat, can't escape back into the atmosphere."", ""Peatlands cover just 3% of land across the globe but store at least twice as much carbon as all the world's forests."", 'They also play a vital role in filtering water. In Ireland and the UK, peatlands are responsible for around 85% of drinking water. ', 'In addition, peatlands are home to an array of highly adapted species - many rare, threatened and in decline.', 'So, the environmental impact of damaged peatlands is multi-fold.', 'Angela Gallego-Sala is a professor of ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles at the University of Exeter. She studies peatlands across the world.', 'She says: ""Globally, the whisky industry uses a tiny amount of peat - but the issue goes beyond carbon."" ', 'To extract peat bricks, explains Prof Gallego-Sala, you have to drain the whole peatland.', '""You affect not just the area of extraction but the whole peatland,"" she says. ""You break the ecosystem. You lose the biodiversity, the water cycling, the carbon cycling.""', 'Prof Gallego-Sala says we have a choice to make. ""Maybe we love whisky so much that it is worth doing, but we need to make an informed decision.""', 'Fettercairn, a distillery in the Scottish Highlands, was founded 175 years ago. In recent years, they have been experimenting with flavours from wood charring, with whisky aged in barrels made from locally sourced oaks. ', 'Nikki Cumming, Whyte and Mackay\'s global brand manager, says: ""Peat is a fundamental aspect of the whisky making industry. Each distillery has a history and for many distilleries that history involves peat.""', 'However, she sees whisky drinkers becoming increasingly open-minded to new flavours.', '""At Fettercairn, peat has never been the focus, as we have a tropical style of flavour,"" she says. ""We\'re building towards the future with local oak and grain so, hopefully, we\'ll still be doing it hundreds of years from now.""', 'So, can whisky lovers learn to live without peat? Should they?', 'Prof Gallego-Sala adds: ""These ecosystems are resilient. They can bounce back, but we don\'t have much time to act. Protecting peatlands is one of the easier ways to make sure we reach net zero.""', 'Back in west Scotland, Ms Thomas sees an evolving whisky industry - and is optimistic.', '""I hope the whisky industry will move quickly to more sustainable practices - replacing fossil fuels to power the distilleries, and addressing unsustainable agricultural practices.""']]","(['Peatlands', 'Scotch whisky', 'Climate change'],)","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12300/production/_126169447_1faa25f0-478d-4178-a735-a5c481068e88.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/30EB/production/_124932521_creditnc'nean-nc'neancasksfirstedition.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11C4F/production/_124938727_peterbignell-creditbelgrovedistillery3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/800F/production/_124938723_creditangelagallego-sala1.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/31EF/production/_124938721_angelagallego-sala.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2533/production/_124932590_nikkicummingheadshot-creditwhyteandmackay.jpg",By Katherine Latham,2022-07-21 23:05:04+00:00

A Women in Motorsport commission was set up in 2010, led by the former rally driver Michele Mouton.

', ""That was in 2002, when they first met in her leafy garden in the upmarket Budapest residential suburb of Pasaret - the Pasha's Meadow, named after the last Turkish ruler of the city. "", 'That passion for learning accompanies Orban to this day - he reads widely, peppers his speeches with thoughts and quotations from world literature, and loves to entertain famous writers and intellectuals in his office in a former convent overlooking the Danube river. ', 'More recently, he waxes lyrical about the ""decline of the West"" - a view he shares with the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, among others. ', 'Alone among EU leaders in 2016, he backed Donald Trump for the White House. Alone among EU leaders, he repeatedly criticises Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

', 'A Nato member since 1999, his government refuses to send arms to Ukraine, or allow the shipment of arms from other countries across Hungarian territory. But his latest controversy hinges on a more ancient argument - about race.', '""There is a world in which European peoples are mixed together with those arriving from outside Europe. Now that is a mixed-race world,"" he told an annual gathering of tens of thousands of admirers at Baile Tusnad in Romania in July. ""And there is our world, where people from within Europe mix with one another… in the Carpathian Basin we are not mixed-race: we are simply a mixture of peoples living in our own European homeland.""', 'Two days later, Zsuzsa Hegedus publicly condemned Orban\'s remarks as ""a pure Nazi text, worthy of Joseph Goebbels"" - Hitler\'s propaganda chief. She resigned as his adviser on social inclusion, and a bruising exchange of letters followed. He said his remarks were misrepresented.', ""The story of the 20-year friendship between the thin, Jewish, chain-smoking, left-wing sociologist and the larger-than-life, right-wing Hungarian leader with a fondness for pork, reveals much about Orban's thinking, his success, and the spell he casts on his admirers - from Texas to Turin. It may also contain the seeds of his downfall."", 'The key to understanding Orban and his Fidesz party, Hegedus explains, ""is that they came from below"". ', 'Orban grew up in a typical rural Communist-era family in the villages of Felcsut and Alcsutdoboz, south of the Hungarian capital. Brought up mostly by his grandparents, his sports teacher was the first to recognise his footballing skills, and took him to the nearby city of Szekesfehervar to buy him his first football boots. ', ""Their common interest in the poor and downtrodden of Hungary brought Orban the politician and Hegedus the sociologist together. His ambition was to return to power and stay there, and for that he needed the rural vote - where the vast majority of Hungarians still live. She was appalled that a quarter of the Hungarian population were living in dire poverty, and was willing to support a leader who didn't just talk, but acted. What a team they could make together, they realised."", 'Since he returned to power in 2010, the number of Hungarians out of work has fallen from 11% to 4%. Marriages have doubled, and divorces and abortions have fallen to record lows. The birth rate has risen by a quarter.', 'In April this year, Orban won his fourth consecutive term in office. Every single settlement with a population under 10,000 voted for his Fidesz party. The election was seen by his critics as free, but not fair - his party, and his messages, dominate the media. He refused to debate with the opposition candidate who was granted just one five-minute slot on state TV. ', '""He has a remarkable ability to spot a political vacuum and occupy it,"" says Hegedus. In 1994, Hungary\'s first post-Communist party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, fell apart. And Viktor Orban converted his small, staunchly liberal party into Hungary\'s main conservative force, in time to win the 1998 elections. ', 'He lost, to his own amazement, in 2002 then painstakingly rebuilt his party, with its roots in the villages and provincial towns, and bounced back to victory in 2010. Orban has run Hungary ever since, with a fatherly hand. So where does she think he has gone astray, I ask his former colleague.', '""The longer they stayed in power, the further they got from the ordinary people,"" she says. For the past four or five years, he has not gone out as much.', 'A hallmark of his years in power has been his unceasing conflict with the European Union, which Hungary joined in 2004. He loves to rail against ""the Brussels bureaucrats"" as much as Donald Trump enjoys provoking US liberals. But Hegedus believes he has got carried away by his own rhetoric. She blames his American former campaign adviser, Arthur J Finkelstein, who was a Republican pollster.', '""The real damage was done in Hungary by Finkelstein\'s thinking."" He would find a theme that divides the country into two warring camps, she says, and then the majority of the population will vote for the toughest position. ', 'In her view, this polarising power is still central to Orban\'s thinking, despite Finkelstein\'s death in 2017. She likens his mixed race speech to him holding a burning match to a barrel of oil. As a looming economic crisis bites in Hungary, she is afraid that, inspired by the prime minister\'s words, ""desperate people will start lynching others - and it\'s all the same who they lynch. Because then it would be too late to stop it"".', 'And does she believe that Viktor Orban has understood her warning? Her answer is a very quiet, less than convincing, ""yes"". She portrays him as a man who takes full responsibility for his decisions, but who can easily be swayed by those in his inner circle - from which she has now withdrawn.', '""Whoever advised him on this speech had in mind, that we need to really whip up a big hatred now. And of course they didn\'t tell Orban that. And from my own experience, and that of my parents [during the Holocaust] I can say: If we let the genie out of the bottle, we cannot put it back in.""', 'Orban was ""discovered"" by Republicans as late as 2021, despite his earlier contacts with the Trump White House, and collaboration with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon in 2019. ', 'Fox News host Tucker Carlson came to Budapest a year ago and presented his show every night from a hotel roof overlooking the city. ""Of the nearly 200 different countries on the face of the earth,"" he told his viewers, ""precisely one of them has an elected leader who publicly identifies as a Western-style conservative. His name is Viktor Orbán.""', ""The next day the Carlson interview with Orban was amply illustrated with footage from their flight together, by helicopter, along the anti-migrant fence Orban has built along Hungary's southern border with Serbia. Orban's anti-immigrant, pro-family, pro-sovereignty messages, have all endeared him to American conservatives. "", 'For Orban, the trip to Texas gives him an opportunity to renew his friendship with Donald Trump and other leading US Republicans, and above all to project himself on the world stage as a champion of national sovereignty, a statesman to take seriously. He clearly hopes that will strengthen his hand in a Europe in which he feels increasingly isolated since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ', 'But he will also be walking a diplomatic tightrope. In his speech in Baile Tusnad, he warned his audience that the reason the US government is so keen to cut Russian gas supplies to Europe, is that it wants to sell its own shale gas to Europe. ', '""The Americans are able to impose their will because they are not dependent on energy from others; they are able to exert hostile pressure because they control the financial networks… for sanctions policy; and they are also able to exert friendly pressure, meaning that they can persuade their allies to buy from them."" ', ""A few days after the war of words between Hegedus and Orban broke out, Hungary's top football team, Ferencvaros, decisively beat old rivals Slovan Bratislava in the European Champions League, 4 -1. Amidst the national euphoria surrounding Orban's favourite sport, few stopped to consider the glaring contradiction between his speech and the victors of the match."", ""Of the 12 players on the pitch that summer's evening, six were Africans, one Dutch, one Bosnian Muslim, two Norwegian, and two Hungarians. Three of the goals were scored by the African players. "", ""The strange reality of Orban's Hungary is that a growing number of people from China, Africa, Russia and Ukraine, as well as the European Union, are making it their home. "", 'As a keen football supporter, Orban knows this very well. Between 2013 and 2017, 18,000 Chinese citizens paid around $300,000 each for Hungarian citizenship - in a residency bond programme introduced by his government. There is also a generous scholarship programme for foreign students, with beneficiaries from all around the world. Many of those students stay on, if they can.  ', 'But that\'s not the message he shares with his supporters. Outside his tent, Hungarians are ""mixing"" more than ever.

It\'s a big feather in India\'s cap to restore a lost treasure,"" says Yadvendradev Jhala, dean of the Wildlife Institute of India, and one of the experts tasked with the effort.  ', ""At least 16 cheetahs are coming to India from South Africa and Namibia, home to more than a third of the world's 7,000 cheetahs. More than half of the world's cheetah population are found in these two countries and Botswana. "", 'In South Africa, cheetahs are found in three different places: a small and declining number are free roaming, living in unprotected areas; a larger, stable population live in large national parks; and the remainder in smaller groups in fenced - mostly privately owned - protected reserves. ', 'The India-bound cats have been mostly picked up from the reserves, where they breed well. There are some 500 adult cheetahs in 50-odd such reserves in South Africa. ', 'Veterinarians fired tranquiliser darts from moving helicopters to capture some of these cheetahs. ""Some of them were slightly wilder,"" muses Vincent van der Merwe, a cheetah conservationist in South Africa who was involved the mission.', 'After capture, the tranquilised cats were microchipped, injected with antibiotics to prevent infection, rehydrated with drips, had their blood taken for DNA and then were put in crates and flown to quarantine facilities.', 'The cheetahs, including more than six females, are young animals in prime breeding age. ""They are cats who have already left their mothers and fully capable of surviving themselves,"" says Mr van der Merwe.', 'The South African cheetahs are now in two quarantine enclosures in a veterinary facility in Rooiiberg and the Phinda game reserve in Zululand. Four others are in Namibia.', 'They have been tested for a number of diseases and vaccinated against at least six, including rabies, blood parasites and herpes. In quarantine, the cheetahs are monitored and observed to ensure that that they have no diseases of concern, says Mr van der Merwe.', 'Experts say wild cheetahs can be difficult to transport as they get stressed by closeness to humans and confinement in crates. ', 'The cheetahs bound for India will have to endure a long flight on a cargo plane from Johannesburg to Delhi and then onwards by road or helicopters to Kuno national park in Madhya Pradesh state, their new home.', 'The cats will be immobilised with tranquilisers on the day of the journey and put in metal crates in the  plane along with wildlife specialists, including a vet. ', 'Once in the crates, the cheetahs will be given an antidote to wake them up from the anaesthetic, but also a mild tranquiliser to keep them awake and calm during the journey. ""This has made it much easier to transport these animals,"" says Adrian Tordiffe, a veterinary wildlife professor at the University of Pretoria.', 'Cheetahs have been transported long distances in the past. Mr van der Merwe says he transported a female cheetah in the back of a vehicle on a 55-hour-road journey from South Africa to Malawi. ""They are very adaptable animals.""

', 'Feeding a cheetah before a long journey can be risky and lead to the cat falling sick and choking on its vomit. ', 'The India-bound cheetahs will not be fed for two days before the journey, says Mr van der Merwe.', 'The cats will be initially quarantined for at least a month in a fenced camp in the Kuno national park.  ', 'This is not for breeding but to anchor them to a central area. ""All cats have homing instincts, and they are inclined to walk back home to where they came from. We break that by putting them up in holding facilities for one or two months,"" says Mr van der Merwe.', 'After that, the cheetahs will be released in the 115,000-hectare national park.', 'Leopards, for one. ', 'They can limit the population by killing cheetah cubs, especially in the Kuno national park. ', 'Cheetahs are delicate animals, meant for speed. They avoid conflict, and are targeted by competing predators.', 'The cheetahs coming to India have been exposed to lions, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs at home. In Kuno, they will have their first encounters with sloth bears, striped hyenas and wolves. ', 'Their main prey base in India will be spotted and large deer and the Indian gazelle, and the four-horned antelope.', '""So we believe that they are experienced enough to handle any dangerous interactions with the leopards in Kuno,"" says Mr van der Merwe.', 'Also, in unfenced reserves like Kuno there is also a possibility that the cheetahs can disperse in any direction and becoming isolated. This will be managed by either satellite or VHF tracking collars to bring them back to the central area.', '""The cheetahs do seem to settle down after a while and we have strategies in place to keep the males, in particular, anchored to the initial release site using scent markings etc,"" says Prof Tordiffe.', 'Relocation of animals is always fraught with risks.', '""We are taking animals out of a familiar environment and it takes time for them to really feel comfortable in their new habitat. It is true that cheetahs are known to have lower survival rates after reintroductions than other large carnivores,"" says Prof Tordiffe.', 'But he points out to a well-documented reintroduction of cheetahs in Malawi where 80% of the adult cheetahs were still alive after a year and that their population managed to grow quite successfully despite the loss of 20% of the cats in the first year.', ""Some Indian conservationists remain sceptical of the idea, saying that most of the country's former cheetah habitats are shrinking because of pressure on land."", ""Officials like Mr Jhala are more optimistic and believe the Kuno park has sufficient space, ample prey and less pressure of human population, all key to the cheetah's survival."", 'India is looking at a capacity population of 20 cheetahs in Kuno national park.  ', 'In five to six years, the country plans to import and locate 50 to 60 cheetahs in half-a-dozen reserves and parks across the country and move the animals around for genetic and and demographic diversity.', 'Experts say this is a key experiment in conservation of the cheetah.

', ""The long-time politician - he's served in the state legislature since 1993 - was on the final stretch of a gruelling campaign, and he thanked the volunteers for agreeing to brave the heat and go knock on doors in a nearby Phoenix suburb."", 'Don Nicoll, who has known Mr Bowers for years, raised his hand. How should he respond if asked about a flurry of recent attacks against Mr Bowers - that he condones paedophilia, or election fraud, or teaching children to hate America? What should he tell voters who think Mr Bowers has been disloyal to Donald Trump or the Republican cause? ', ""Mr Bowers shook his head and laughed. It's not the kind of question he's used to. "", ""For most of his political career, the 69-year-old Arizona native - a former artist raised on a sheep ranch in Chino Valley - has been a safe bet for re-election. But that was before then-President Trump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pressured Mr Bowers, speaker of the state's House of Representatives, to discard the 2020 presidential election results that showed Democrat Joe Biden winning Arizona by roughly 11,000 votes. "", 'It was before Mr Bowers travelled to Washington DC in June and testified to the congressional committee investigating the US Capitol riot.

And at a rally last Friday in the northern Arizona town of Prescott Valley, not far from the ranch where Mr Bowers grew up, Mr Trump singled him out by name.', '""Rusty Bowers is a \'Rino\' coward who participated against the Republican party in the totally partisan unselect committee of political thugs and hacks the other day and disgraced himself, and he disgraced the state of Arizona,"" the former president said, using a derisive acronym for ""Republican in name only"".', 'In April, Mr Bowers was awarded a John F Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for resisting Mr Trump\'s election pressure.

Some Trump-endorsed candidates, such as JD Vance in Ohio, Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, Herschel Walker in Georgia and Chris Cox in Maryland, have won, occasionally against sizeable odds. Others - Janice McGeachen of Idaho, David Perdue in Georgia and Charles Herbster of Nebraska, among them - have not.', 'In few states was the divide within the Republican party on as stark display as in Arizona. The party infrastructure is entirely controlled by Trump loyalists - last year, the state sanctioned a questionable, privately contracted ""ballot audit"" of the 2020 election. The current officeholders are divided between Trump die-hards like congressman Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs, who took part in White House meetings to plan ways to overturn the 2020 election results, and Governor Doug Ducey, who memorably sent a call from Donald Trump to voicemail as he was certifying Joe Biden\'s Arizona victory.', ""Today's Arizona electorate is divided roughly into thirds - one part Democrats, one part Republicans and one part independents who do not identify with a political party or participate in the primaries that choose its nominees."", ""Kevin DeMenna, a longtime Arizona political consultant and Republican strategist, said the Republican third, which has been shedding supporters to the independent bloc, is now comprised primarily of Mr Trump's supporters. "", '""We\'re at a breaking point where I think Trump, the weight of what he has brought to Arizona politics, is going to lead to a family feud,"" he said. ""Right now, the Republican party is not a machine that elects or defeats candidates. It\'s a Trump propaganda arm."" ', 'On the same day that Mr Trump held his Prescott Valley rally, Mr Ducey was in Phoenix, with Mr Bowers and former Vice-President Mike Pence, who was holding an event to support Karrin Taylor Robson, a candidate for governor .', 'In a recent governor\'s debate, Ms Robson was the only Republican not to raise her hand when asked if the 2020 election was stolen from Mr Trump. And in his remarks, Mr Pence tried to draw a line between candidates like Ms Robson and those endorsed by his former boss - albeit while still trying to boast of the record of the ""Trump-Pence administration"".', '""There are those who want to make this election about the past,"" he told the crowd. ""You can send a deafening message that can be heard all across America that the Republican Party is the party of the future.""', ""The past or the future? Trump or someone else?

"", 'Trump rallies are political cocoons, where supporters gather with fellow fans to celebrate their man and his ""Make America Great Again"" movement. Outside a 6,000-seat sports arena in Prescott Valley last Friday, thousands of Trump loyalists lined up for hours in 100F (37C) heat to get good seats.

""That\'s a strike against him right there. That was not an insurrection. Those were peaceful protests.""', ""Taylor Byerly recently moved to Arizona from San Francisco, where she said she never felt comfortable wearing her Maga hat. In Arizona, she fits right in - and brought her seven-month-old daughter to the rally. She said she'll vote for whomever Mr Trump endorses."", '""I could do research, but the internet lies,"" she adds. ""So if Trump is saying they\'re a good person, that\'s all I need to hear."" ', ""According to Mr DeMenna, the Republican strategist, these kinds of views are common among those who vote in the party's primaries."", '""Donald Trump\'s doing well,"" he said. ""Every candidate that he has endorsed has experienced a measurable increase in voter support. The loyalty, the fealty of the Maga crowd is unparalleled.""', 'Inside the arena, the message was similar. ', '""We have got an America First slate like you would never believe here in Arizona,"" Arizona Republican Party chairwoman Kelli Ward - who technically is not supposed to make endorsements in the primary - told the crowd, after listing off Trump-endorsed candidates she had already cast her postal ballot for. ', '""The swampy, consultant-loving, money-grubbing GOP establishment wants to install their choices. Do not allow it.""', ""When told of Mr Trump's comments during the Arizona rally, Mr Bowers said he's puzzled that the president would go out of his way to attack him personally.

He\'s the former president of the United States of America.""', 'But when it comes to questioning his conservative credentials - as someone who has worked in Republican politics since the 1990s - that makes him angry. ', '""What is a conservative?"" he asked. ""Now it\'s been stolen, and the name doesn\'t mean what it used to. It meant to conserve long-term, institutionally proven things in a culture - family, economic power, education, freedom - things that you would want to conserve.""', 'He said he feels alienated from his party, but that there are ""hundreds of thousands"" of Arizonans who feel the same way and have left the Republican party to be politically independent or unaffiliated.', '""The usurpation of the party, I call it a coup, it\'s been growing for some time,"" he said. ""There\'s this sanitising of the party, over and over.""', 'After talking with his supporters back near Phoenix, Rusty Bowers set out to do some door-knocking of his own. Donning a wide-brimmed hat to cover his balding head, he went in search of voters - some identified by local voter data spit out by a mobile phone app that he seemed somewhat unsure how to use and others just through random stops.', 'He found a person who, coincidentally, was a high-school classmate of his wife - one of the benefits of having roots in an area built up over decades.', 'Then he met Pamela, in a nearby house, who was just about to fill out her mail-in primary ballot.

""We don\'t need those radicals. It\'s turning everything into so much confrontation."" ', ""After the chat, Mr Bowers and his campaign manager stuck a yard sign in Pamela's gravel-and-cactus covered front yard. One voter down, thousands more to go."", 'The reality, however, was that Mr Bowers had an uphill battle to stay in office. When he asked Pamela if there was anyone else in the neighbourhood she thought he might visit, she struggled to come up with an answer. Most, she said, were hardcore Republicans. One couple, she added, always flew Trump flags in their yard.', '""I don\'t want to fight with them,"" Mr Bowers said.', ""On Tuesday, Mr Bowers learned his fate. Before his defeat, he said he would be at peace with such an outcome. When it's all done, he continued, he'll leave a legacy of courage, not cowardice, for his 20 grandchildren."", 'But he also had a parting word of warning for Republicans - and Americans - in Arizona and across the nation.', '""The bully party of the Trump express, get ready for it,"" he said.

World,3,180.0,www.bbc.com,0.544180154800415,US & Canada,The controversial Hungarian leader will be warmly received when he addresses US Republicans.,"Orban alone in Europe, among friends in Texas",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62408368,"['Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban may have alienated his EU neighbours, who accuse him of undermining democracy, but he will get a warm reception thousands of miles away at a conservative conference in Texas on Thursday. How did this unlikely love affair blossom?', ['""He has a real hunger for knowledge,"" says Zsuzsa Hegedus about her friend Viktor Orban. ', '""So apart from the fact that we laughed a lot… he wasn\'t just interested in what I had to say, he really wanted to understand."" ', ""That was in 2002, when they first met in her leafy garden in the upmarket Budapest residential suburb of Pasaret - the Pasha's Meadow, named after the last Turkish ruler of the city. "", 'That passion for learning accompanies Orban to this day - he reads widely, peppers his speeches with thoughts and quotations from world literature, and loves to entertain famous writers and intellectuals in his office in a former convent overlooking the Danube river. ', 'More recently, he waxes lyrical about the ""decline of the West"" - a view he shares with the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, among others. ', 'Alone among EU leaders in 2016, he backed Donald Trump for the White House. Alone among EU leaders, he repeatedly criticises Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And alone among EU leaders, he slams sanctions on Russian oil and gas as doing more to harm the EU than Russia. ', 'A Nato member since 1999, his government refuses to send arms to Ukraine, or allow the shipment of arms from other countries across Hungarian territory. But his latest controversy hinges on a more ancient argument - about race.', '""There is a world in which European peoples are mixed together with those arriving from outside Europe. Now that is a mixed-race world,"" he told an annual gathering of tens of thousands of admirers at Baile Tusnad in Romania in July. ""And there is our world, where people from within Europe mix with one another… in the Carpathian Basin we are not mixed-race: we are simply a mixture of peoples living in our own European homeland.""', 'Two days later, Zsuzsa Hegedus publicly condemned Orban\'s remarks as ""a pure Nazi text, worthy of Joseph Goebbels"" - Hitler\'s propaganda chief. She resigned as his adviser on social inclusion, and a bruising exchange of letters followed. He said his remarks were misrepresented.', ""The story of the 20-year friendship between the thin, Jewish, chain-smoking, left-wing sociologist and the larger-than-life, right-wing Hungarian leader with a fondness for pork, reveals much about Orban's thinking, his success, and the spell he casts on his admirers - from Texas to Turin. It may also contain the seeds of his downfall."", 'The key to understanding Orban and his Fidesz party, Hegedus explains, ""is that they came from below"". ', 'Orban grew up in a typical rural Communist-era family in the villages of Felcsut and Alcsutdoboz, south of the Hungarian capital. Brought up mostly by his grandparents, his sports teacher was the first to recognise his footballing skills, and took him to the nearby city of Szekesfehervar to buy him his first football boots. ', ""Their common interest in the poor and downtrodden of Hungary brought Orban the politician and Hegedus the sociologist together. His ambition was to return to power and stay there, and for that he needed the rural vote - where the vast majority of Hungarians still live. She was appalled that a quarter of the Hungarian population were living in dire poverty, and was willing to support a leader who didn't just talk, but acted. What a team they could make together, they realised."", 'Since he returned to power in 2010, the number of Hungarians out of work has fallen from 11% to 4%. Marriages have doubled, and divorces and abortions have fallen to record lows. The birth rate has risen by a quarter.', 'In April this year, Orban won his fourth consecutive term in office. Every single settlement with a population under 10,000 voted for his Fidesz party. The election was seen by his critics as free, but not fair - his party, and his messages, dominate the media. He refused to debate with the opposition candidate who was granted just one five-minute slot on state TV. ', '""He has a remarkable ability to spot a political vacuum and occupy it,"" says Hegedus. In 1994, Hungary\'s first post-Communist party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, fell apart. And Viktor Orban converted his small, staunchly liberal party into Hungary\'s main conservative force, in time to win the 1998 elections. ', 'He lost, to his own amazement, in 2002 then painstakingly rebuilt his party, with its roots in the villages and provincial towns, and bounced back to victory in 2010. Orban has run Hungary ever since, with a fatherly hand. So where does she think he has gone astray, I ask his former colleague.', '""The longer they stayed in power, the further they got from the ordinary people,"" she says. For the past four or five years, he has not gone out as much.', 'A hallmark of his years in power has been his unceasing conflict with the European Union, which Hungary joined in 2004. He loves to rail against ""the Brussels bureaucrats"" as much as Donald Trump enjoys provoking US liberals. But Hegedus believes he has got carried away by his own rhetoric. She blames his American former campaign adviser, Arthur J Finkelstein, who was a Republican pollster.', '""The real damage was done in Hungary by Finkelstein\'s thinking."" He would find a theme that divides the country into two warring camps, she says, and then the majority of the population will vote for the toughest position. ', 'In her view, this polarising power is still central to Orban\'s thinking, despite Finkelstein\'s death in 2017. She likens his mixed race speech to him holding a burning match to a barrel of oil. As a looming economic crisis bites in Hungary, she is afraid that, inspired by the prime minister\'s words, ""desperate people will start lynching others - and it\'s all the same who they lynch. Because then it would be too late to stop it"".', 'And does she believe that Viktor Orban has understood her warning? Her answer is a very quiet, less than convincing, ""yes"". She portrays him as a man who takes full responsibility for his decisions, but who can easily be swayed by those in his inner circle - from which she has now withdrawn.', '""Whoever advised him on this speech had in mind, that we need to really whip up a big hatred now. And of course they didn\'t tell Orban that. And from my own experience, and that of my parents [during the Holocaust] I can say: If we let the genie out of the bottle, we cannot put it back in.""', 'Orban was ""discovered"" by Republicans as late as 2021, despite his earlier contacts with the Trump White House, and collaboration with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon in 2019. ', 'Fox News host Tucker Carlson came to Budapest a year ago and presented his show every night from a hotel roof overlooking the city. ""Of the nearly 200 different countries on the face of the earth,"" he told his viewers, ""precisely one of them has an elected leader who publicly identifies as a Western-style conservative. His name is Viktor Orbán.""', ""The next day the Carlson interview with Orban was amply illustrated with footage from their flight together, by helicopter, along the anti-migrant fence Orban has built along Hungary's southern border with Serbia. Orban's anti-immigrant, pro-family, pro-sovereignty messages, have all endeared him to American conservatives. "", 'For Orban, the trip to Texas gives him an opportunity to renew his friendship with Donald Trump and other leading US Republicans, and above all to project himself on the world stage as a champion of national sovereignty, a statesman to take seriously. He clearly hopes that will strengthen his hand in a Europe in which he feels increasingly isolated since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ', 'But he will also be walking a diplomatic tightrope. In his speech in Baile Tusnad, he warned his audience that the reason the US government is so keen to cut Russian gas supplies to Europe, is that it wants to sell its own shale gas to Europe. ', '""The Americans are able to impose their will because they are not dependent on energy from others; they are able to exert hostile pressure because they control the financial networks… for sanctions policy; and they are also able to exert friendly pressure, meaning that they can persuade their allies to buy from them."" ', ""A few days after the war of words between Hegedus and Orban broke out, Hungary's top football team, Ferencvaros, decisively beat old rivals Slovan Bratislava in the European Champions League, 4 -1. Amidst the national euphoria surrounding Orban's favourite sport, few stopped to consider the glaring contradiction between his speech and the victors of the match."", ""Of the 12 players on the pitch that summer's evening, six were Africans, one Dutch, one Bosnian Muslim, two Norwegian, and two Hungarians. Three of the goals were scored by the African players. "", ""The strange reality of Orban's Hungary is that a growing number of people from China, Africa, Russia and Ukraine, as well as the European Union, are making it their home. "", 'As a keen football supporter, Orban knows this very well. Between 2013 and 2017, 18,000 Chinese citizens paid around $300,000 each for Hungarian citizenship - in a residency bond programme introduced by his government. There is also a generous scholarship programme for foreign students, with beneficiaries from all around the world. Many of those students stay on, if they can.  ', 'But that\'s not the message he shares with his supporters. Outside his tent, Hungarians are ""mixing"" more than ever.

The fallout has many asking: is ice hockey facing a widespread reckoning? ', ['Hockey Canada, which manages programmes and teams in the country from entry-level all the way to world championships and the Olympic Games, has been rocked by public allegations of sexual assault against its players since earlier this year.', ""The sports body - largely seen as Canada's voice for ice hockey on the international stage - is now facing consequences not seen in its storied 108-year-old history."", 'In recent weeks, major sponsors have fled, parliament has launched a probe into the organisation and frozen federal funding and its senior leadership is under mounting pressure to resign. ', 'Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the organisation needs a ""real reckoning"". ', 'Hockey Canada has since vowed to ""shatter the code of silence"" and to ""eliminate toxic behaviour in and around Canada\'s game"". ', ""The outcry and scrutiny stem from allegations of sexual assault against members of Canada's national junior hockey team, some dating back decades, that have surfaced in the last few months."", ""Experts say the issue has since ignited a national conversation about a culture of silence in the sport, and questions as to whether ice hockey's place as the centrepiece of Canadian culture has shielded it from criticism and accountability."", 'It all began last April, when a 24-year-old woman filed a lawsuit against Hockey Canada alleging that she was assaulted by eight players, including members of the World Junior team, in the town of London, Ontario.', 'The alleged assault took place in a hotel room in the summer of 2018, following a Hockey Canada Foundation fundraising event while she was intoxicated, and she later felt pressured not to report the incident to police, according to the lawsuit. ', 'In May this year, sports network TSN revealed Hockey Canada had quietly reached a settlement with the woman.', ""Neither the woman nor the accused players have been named publicly, though a number of players from that year's team, now in the National Hockey League (NHL), have issued statements denying any involvement. "", 'In June, troubled by how Hockey Canada handled the incident and amid concern federal funds it received may have been used to settle the lawsuit, a parliamentary committee launched a series of high-profile hearings into the organisation and its leadership. ', 'That parliamentary probe has since raised more questions about how Hockey Canada, which recently reported an annual revenue of C$61m (£38.9m), dealt with the 2018 case and other past sexual misconduct allegations. ', 'Amid the scrutiny, it was revealed that the organisation had used its National Equity Fund - made up of membership fees paid by young players across the country - to settle past sexual assault claims. ', ""It was a revelation met with anger from Canada's hockey parents - and a practice Hockey Canada has since announced it has cancelled. "", 'It has said it dealt with one to two sexual assault allegations per year over the last six years, and has paid out C$8.9m in 21 settlements since 1989. ', ""In a July hearing, Hockey Canada's lawyers also testified that the organisation's vice-president of risk management contacted them first about the 2018 allegations before taking it to the local police. "", 'The team\'s players were also not required to participate in the third-party investigation commissioned by Hockey Canada to look into the assault. That was closed in September 2020 ""without prejudice to reopening it later"", the lawyers said, because the alleged victim declined to participate at the time. ', 'The woman has since come forward and said she did cooperate with the police investigation, disputing a prior statement by Hockey Canada that said otherwise.', '""I think it\'s fair to say Canadians have lost confidence in Hockey Canada,"" said Peter Julian, a member of Parliament with the New Democratic Party, who sits on the committee looking into the organisation. ', 'It is no secret that Canada has prided itself on the toughness of its hockey players.', 'Children of dedicated hockey parents step foot on the ice at a very young age. They spend hours on rinks and on buses to and from games and tournaments. ', 'Those disciplined and talented enough to play at an elite level earn the title of hometown hero - a source of pride for the community that raised them. ', ""Some say devotion to the sport in Canada is akin to that of a religion - one that dates back to the country's founding, when hockey served as a distinct marker for its national identity. "", '""It\'s this idea that hockey is played on the frozen ponds in the backyard, that we are a cold place where people can strap on skates and go out and play,"" said Kristi Allain, an associate professor of sociology at St Thomas University in New Brunswick. ', 'Ms Allain said this ""wholesome"" vision of hockey is largely based on mythologised ideals of a sport that is rooted in violence and problematic ideals of rugged masculinity.', 'This romanticisation is why, Ms Allain said, it has been hard to achieve a meaningful reckoning within leagues and governing bodies, despite years of mounting scrutiny.', 'This is not the first high-profile case of sexual misconduct in Canadian hockey. In 1996, NHL player Sheldon Kennedy accused his junior league coach of sexually abusing him over the course of a decade.', 'That coach, Graham James, was sentenced to five years in prison for the abuse, but some have criticised sport officials for not doing enough to enact systemic change in the aftermath of that national scandal.', ""Another high-profile case involved Chicago Blackhawks left winger Kyle Beach, who went public last year with allegations he was sexually assaulted by the team's former video coach during the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs. "", ""An investigation later revealed the team was aware of Mr Beach's claims at the time but decided not to address them until after the Blackhawks' victorious championship run. "", 'Other players have spoken out in recent years against a culture of racism in hockey, specifically towards black and indigenous players. ', 'The tide now appears to be shifting, Ms Allain said. ""This isn\'t the first time these stories have come up, but this is the first time we\'ve seen sponsors walk away,"" she said. ', 'It appears to be tied to a ""unique cultural moment"", where the general public is becoming more aware of the serious nature of sexual misconduct, said Katie Strang, a senior writer for The Athletic who has long covered hockey and allegations of abuse within it. ', 'Other national sports bodies have faced their own reckonings worldwide, including USA Gymnastics - whose team doctor was convicted in 2017 of sexually abusing minors after members of the US national team came forward.', 'Football in the UK also had a sexual misconduct scandal in 2016 after allegations of abuse surfaced, which led to a landmark report that found the English Football Association culpable of ""institutional failure"" due to a lack of protection policies, especially for minors. ', 'With the spotlight now on Hockey Canada, Ms Strang anticipated ""an avalanche of survivors"" will likely come forward with their own stories. ', '""The reason you are seeing this level of scrutiny, even up to the highest federal level, is the fact that Hockey Canada, which is a behemoth in Canadian sporting culture, settled this case,"" said Ms Strang, raising questions about the organisation\'s commitment to transparency on this issue.', 'She also anticipated a heightened pressure on sporting bodies as a whole to ensure players and the community surrounding them are kept safe from abuse. ', 'Hockey Canada has promised sweeping changes, including mandating a lifetime ban on players who refuse to cooperate in investigations and implementing a system to report and track complaints of abuse and harassment. ', ""Meanwhile, police in London have reopened their investigation into the alleged assault in 2018, and Hockey Canada's own third-party probe has been reopened. "", 'The NHL has said it is also looking into the incident. ', 'Further allegations have surfaced involving the 2003 World Juniors hockey team - a case the organisation is now investigating and which is being looked into by local police. ', 'And parliamentary committee hearings are expected to continue later this year. ', ""Chris Bittle, a Liberal MP on the committee, said the buck likely doesn't stop with ice hockey. Allegations of abuse have also been levelled against the body governing gymnastics in Canada. "", '""[The parliamentary probe] may need to be far broader than just Hockey Canada,"" he said.

Birkenhead is trying a new way to support addicts and save lives. "", [""Mike looks smart in his white shirt and pressed grey suit. It's graduation day - but the 28-year-old is not at college or university. Instead, he has just finished the final stage at the recovery academy. Mike is 443 days sober."", 'His destructive relationship with alcohol and cocaine began in his late teens with nights out drinking. But it got worse aged 23, when his mum Margaret found her breast cancer had spread to other parts of her body. She would not survive. ', '""When Mum passed away, everything just sort of fell away,"" says Mike. He ended up in a nasty, sinister place, he says, describing it as ""the madness"".', '""I felt like I was in my own movie, because I was [the star] when I was drunk. The ego. Obsessive Mike. Controlling Mike.""', 'He would eventually lose his job, home and relationship with his partner and young son. He also nearly lost his liberty.', 'In February 2020, he was arrested on suspicion of actual bodily harm. It was while in the police cell he realised he had to change his life to avoid ending up in prison. ', '""I was destroying people who loved and cared for me, but I was also destroying myself in the process.""', ""Fortunately for Mike, the police didn't charge him - instead officers gave him a leaflet for a local drug and alcohol support service. Mike already knew the team at Wirral Ways, as he had stopped drinking four times before. But this time, he felt it would be different and got in touch. "", 'Birkenhead is fast becoming regarded as one of the best places in England for addiction support. Here, local organisations have completely changed the way they work together and are now all part of a ""recovery village"". ', 'The ""village"" is a range of established services and organisations - which are all based within a square mile - now they have come together for the first time to give coordinated support to those in treatment. It includes education, employment, health services, housing, support groups as well as recovery and rehabilitation.', '""That place is the devil,"" says Mike, pointing at a row of pubs and bars across the street and remembering his nights on beer and cocaine. He has met us outside Nightingales Cafe - a place that\'s been front and centre helping him get sober and off drugs. ', '""It depends what side of the street you want to be on, doesn\'t it?"" he says. ""I get flashbacks to me being kicked out [of one of the pubs] because I\'m too pissed.""', 'Downstairs at Nightingales, run by Wirral Ways, you can get a coffee and a bite to eat, make friends and get support. Cafe staff are on their own addiction journeys, getting back into work and giving something back to their community. ', 'Upstairs, there are more specialist services. An intensive rehabilitation programme, support groups and courses - as well as staff who can give practical advice with housing and employment. It is where Mike got the help he needed. ', 'Those running upstairs sessions at Nightingales come with first-hand experience of living with addiction. They know it is about honesty, reflection and encouragement - not about wiping out the past, living with regret or forgetting. ', 'Recovering addicts are challenged to find their core values and accept the hurt and destruction their actions may have caused.', '""I used to neck a bottle of wine on my way home, even though I only live five minutes from work,"" says one woman - while a man explains how he is probably in a better place than he has ever been. ""On the face of it, I\'ve lost everything - but this place has saved my life and given me a new direction.""', ""Meetings like this are about believing in people, meeting individuals' specific needs and helping them give back to their community - says Andrew Cass, services manager at Wirral Ways, part of national organisation Change Grow Live. "", 'There are plenty in Birkenhead who need that kind of support. The town took the full force of the 1980s recession. As the shipyards failed and unemployment rose, heroin took hold.', '""Young people didn\'t see a future. Some estates in Birkenhead were among the first places where the [national] heroin epidemic started,"" says Andrew.', ""Birkenhead's geography has compounded the problem further. It is like an island - encircled by water and a motorway. On one side, there is the River Mersey with Liverpool's recognisable skyline in the distance. On the other, the M53 sweeps around like a barrier, separating the town from Wirral's more affluent suburbs."", 'Birkenhead\'s socio-economic complexities were part of the reason why Andrew moved towards the ""recovery village"" concept. The open-door ethos is important, says Jennifer, a recovering alcoholic working at another local organisation - the Spider Project - which offers training and activities, such as music, pottery and drama, to addicts who have stopped taking drink or drugs.', '""There\'s nothing worse than having doors closed on you. A lot of us, we\'ve experienced doors constantly being closed. Even if someone is still using [drugs], we\'re not going to kick them out. We\'re going to make sure they get the necessary help.""', 'Latest figures show more lives are being lost to drugs and alcohol than ever before. In 2020, more than 4,500 people died from drug poisoning in England and Wales - the highest number since records began in 1993, and up more than 60% on 2010 figures.', 'Last year, across England, support for addiction was described as ""not fit for purpose"" by senior government advisor Dame Carol Black. In an independent report, she highlighted decades of underfunding, decimated services and a shattered workforce. ', 'Dame Carol managed to get the government to commit to £780m of funding - less than the £1bn she requested - but still enough, she argues, to bring innovation and change to treatment services.', '""If you get people into good treatment, and good recovery programmes, we know from research in this country, murders go down, acquisitive crime [when offenders gain materially] goes down, and less people go to prison.""', 'While the new funding may sound like a lot of money, it is a small fraction of the amount drugs cost England each year. ', '""The total cost of drug addiction at the moment is £19.2bn a year - compared to £780m [of new funding]. I think that\'s quite a good equation,"" she said.', 'In Birkenhead, the ""village"" concept was created before Dame Carol\'s report came out. They felt they were already on the right path. ', ""We meet Mike again a few months later - in September 2021 - at the family home he shares with his dad, Kevin. It would have been his mum Margaret's 68th birthday. The family has cards, flowers and balloons to put by her grave. Mike reads us the message he has written for her."", '""I know you are guiding me on the path I\'m on and I hope you are proud. I love you so much. You are sorely missed.""', 'Mike picks up a photo taken on the day she died. In it, Mike\'s arm is around his dad. ""I\'m probably under the influence there, believe it or not. I am so thin there. My life was just drinking and using."" ', 'Mike shares news that he has got some temporary work supporting addicts at Wirral Ways. ""He really has done marvellous,"" says dad Kevin proudly.', 'But despite that, Mike and his girlfriend Hannah say it has been a rough few weeks. Mike has stumbled in his recovery. He has not turned to drink or drugs, but he has felt very low. ', 'The summer has been stressful. He wants to see more of his young son. And living in a home where there is alcohol - his dad admits that he too has a drink problem - has also proved challenging.', 'But Mike and Hannah have a plan for the future.', 'On Market Street in Birkenhead, a tall, thin, bookish-looking man walks into Wirral Ways for a scheduled appointment. Tony is 58 and has been addicted to heroin for nearly 40 years - a survivor of the 1980s drug ""epidemic"" that swept the town.', '""We feel love and hate like everybody else. We\'re human beings. Most drug addicts have a reason they\'re addicted,"" he says.', 'Tony has paranoid schizophrenia and is under the care of a community psychiatric nurse. He says the condition was triggered by the deaths of his parents when he was a teenager - and heroin helps him control it. ', 'For the past week, he has resisted taking any street heroin he may have bought. ""It\'s been murder,"" he says - but he is determined to show the doctor that he wants to address his drug misuse and continue to collect his weekly prescription for methadone, a medical substitute for heroin.', 'The prescription gets approved, but during the appointment there is also a chance to talk about Tony\'s mental health - all part of Birkenhead\'s ""joined-up"" approach. The doctor works with Tony\'s psychiatric nurse and key worker, John, who helps Tony navigate through the range of services in the ""village"". ', 'Tony invites us to his flat - it is modest, clean and tidy. There are music keyboards and synthesisers - and a whiteboard covered in quantum physics equations which he has written out. On the walls are professional-quality photographs he has taken.', '""I\'m mentally ill, that is a fact. I\'m good at looking and being normal. But, at base level, I struggle to hang on to reality sometimes,"" he tells us. He accepts there is a stigma to being an addict with mental health issues. ""I get called a junkie and crackhead. It\'s not nice but, at the end of the day, that\'s what I am."" ', 'Loneliness is perhaps the worst thing. ""I sleep on my own. I wake up alone. I\'m not good with women. I\'ve got no self-confidence. So I\'m just single. It\'s the best policy for me."" ', 'During another visit to Tony\'s place, he suddenly needs a ""fix"" and smokes heroin while we are there. ""I am not ashamed,"" he insists, as the acrid smell fills the air. Doesn\'t he realise how dangerous heroin is?', '""Of course I do, yeah. It could kill me. It could kill me.""', 'He says he appreciates that he ""wouldn\'t be here"" if it wasn\'t for the professional support he receives.', 'Does his continued use of heroin mean Tony is a failure? Has the ""village"" failed him?', ""Key worker John, who has helped Tony for more than five years, doesn't think so. For him, success isn't as simple as measuring how many people come completely off drugs or drink. It is more subtle than that - about understanding that addiction is a chronic illness which needs long-term support. "", 'Tony, for instance, came off crack cocaine. It was threatening his life. John says that was a big step forward. ""As long as he\'s not using [drugs] all day, every day - and his life isn\'t unravelling in front of him - I think he is sustaining his life,"" he says.', 'It is early December, and Mike and Hannah have taken a big step forward. They have found a home to rent. Mike proudly gives us a tour.', 'He shows us the bedroom they are preparing for his son. Mike has already started seeing him again and is looking forward to him staying overnight.', 'Hannah says Mike is getting better all the time and is less stressed now they have their own place. Mike says he still enjoys his job at Wirral Ways\' recovery centre. ""I can help people like myself. It\'s really a privileged position."" ', 'Just around the corner from where Mike works is a trendy new coffee shop with a difference. Funded by the NHS - and yet another part of Birkenhead\'s ""recovery village"" - Compañeros offers a sanctuary to many. ', 'Anyone who considers themselves to be in a mental health crisis can come through the door. ', ""Inside, there is on-the-day help from experienced support staff - many of whom have had mental health issues themselves. Even if they can't talk to you straight away, you are encouraged to stay, to try to relax and maybe take part in a group activity - such as music discussion, creative writing or yoga."", 'The hope is it will help relieve pressure on A&E and other services. ', 'Compañeros has already worked for Rob who, in his early 40s, had hit rock bottom. He would drink every day. ""Parts of my family, my circle of friends, don\'t understand how ill I was. How close I was… this place did, they got it.""', 'Compañeros saved his life, he says.', 'Cafe manager Joe Ackland is proud of what has been achieved in just a few months. ""This is a place where people can feel safe and be heard. To be honest, I just wish [these cafes] could be all over the country."" ', 'It is March 2022 and Dame Carol Black has asked to visit the ""village"" to see the joined-up work for herself. ', 'She meets Mike in the room above Nightingales Cafe where he has previously confronted some of the harshest realities of his addiction. He proudly announces he has been sober and clean for two years to the day. He also says he has become a peer-to-peer mentor, a former addict who helps people still using. It is an essential support role highlighted by Dame Carol in her report.', '""I\'ve got a real passion for this and I really want to help people.""', 'Dame Carol\'s face breaks into a beaming smile. ""Fantastic,"" she says, ""that makes me very happy."" ', 'Dame Carol is excited by what she has seen in Birkenhead - describing the approach as not just about treatment, but ""a real attempt at recovery"". ', '""I simply hope that people who, in my opinion, have been treated rather like lepers, are now on a journey which treats them as people with a health condition.""', 'Meanwhile, Mike knows he is on his journey for the rest of his life.', '""I\'m extremely happy.

', 'One commander in northern Russia requested a criminal case be brought against his subordinate who would not return to Ukraine, but a military prosecutor refused to proceed, according to documents seen by the BBC. Such an action would be ""premature"" without having assessed the harm to the military service he was involved in, the prosecutor said. ', 'And there is no guarantee that more prosecutions might not emerge in the future.', 'Soldiers like Sergey - reluctant to return to the front line - are not unusual, according to Ruslan Leviev, the editor of Conflict Intelligence Team, a media project investigating the experiences of the Russian military in Ukraine through confidential interviews and open source material. ', 'Leviev says his team estimates a sizeable minority of the Russian contract soldiers sent to Ukraine to fight in the initial invasion refused to go back again.', 'Independent Russian media have also been reporting hundreds of cases of soldiers refusing repeat deployments to Ukraine since the beginning of April. ', 'Several lawyers and human rights activists the BBC spoke to said they had been regularly offering advice to men trying to avoid returning to Ukraine. Each of our interviewees had dealt with dozens of cases and believed those soldiers were also sharing advice with their colleagues.', ""Although Sergey does not want to return to the front line, he does want to complete his outstanding military service in Russia to avoid any unforeseen consequences. But that means that - while his letter of refusal to fight was accepted - there are no guarantees he won't be sent back to Ukraine during his service period."", '""I can see that the war continues, it is not going away,"" he told the BBC.

It has also spoken to a dozen current and former Calcot employees. They told us the company had accepted high-risk children, who came with increased levels of funding, but did not meet all their needs and keep them safe. Our investigation found:', 'The Children\'s Commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, told us she was ""appalled"" by our findings and said they revealed ""actual harm"".', 'One former Calcot support worker we spoke to, Mia*, said it seemed to her that Calcot put profit before childcare and suffered from ""chronic"" under-staffing.', 'She felt it was all about ""getting that high-level amount of funding for children with challenging behaviour"".

In Chelsea Flower week, we look at a recent discovery which sheds new light on the gardening great - and her rude behaviour."", [""Miss Willmott's Ghost is a silvery, spiky sea holly that has a ghost-like appearance in gardens at dusk. Many gardening sites attribute its name to the infamous 19th Century horticulturist Ellen Ann Willmott. It was said Ellen would carry the seeds of this thorny plant in her handbag and scatter them surreptitiously in other people's gardens to sabotage their designs. "", 'Rumour had it that Miss Willmott would carry around a loaded revolver in that handbag, too. But is this picture of a pistol-carrying guerrilla gardener accurate? ', ""Ellen Ann Willmott was one of the leading gardeners, plant hunters and botanical photographers of her day. In 1897, she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's (RHS) most prestigious tribute, the Victoria Medal of Honour, a sign of how much her work was admired in an industry heavily populated by men. "", 'Of the 60 gold medals that were given out that year, only two were awarded to women - but Ellen never showed up to collect her award, sparking shock and disdain.', '""The master of ceremonies kept having to say, \'Lady and gentlemen,\' and he found this very embarrassing,"" says Sandra Lawrence, who has written a new book about the gardener.', ""Sandra, who has been fascinated with Ellen Ann Willmott ever since visiting her gardens as a child, says most people would just have assumed that Ellen couldn't be bothered to collect her medal and that it was typical of her."", '""Nobody doubts that she was an incredible horticulturalist, a fascinating and very learned woman,"" says Sandra. But Ellen also had a reputation for not being very nice. ""People have remembered her as being eccentric, grumpy, prickly. She gets accused of being both a miser and a spendthrift - and that she did unpleasant things.""', ""But recently, Sandra discovered the likely reason for Ellen's no-show at one of the biggest events of her life wasn't rudeness, but the abrupt end to a love affair. "", 'Ellen Ann Willmott grew up at Warley Place, a house and grounds in Brentwood, Essex. The family were comfortably middle class - but Ellen was a largely self-taught gardener, says Sandra, ""because girls didn\'t get that kind of education"". Still, under her influence the gardens at Warley Place became recognised internationally and were visited by the Royal Family. She cultivated stunning new species of daffodils and introduced a striking alpine rock garden, with cascading streams and a fern grotto.', 'As a child, Sandra used to explore the remnants of the alpine garden and hothouses once so loved by Ellen. ""It was like my very own secret garden and I was sure there was treasure there,"" she says. Eventually she did discover riches - but not at Warley. ', ""Following Ellen's death in 1934, her belongings were sent to Spetchley Park near Worcester, the home of her sister who married into the Berkeley family. "", 'They languished there until 2019, when trunks filled with items were discovered rotting in a basement. With only days to clear it before builders arrived to start conservation work on the mansion, Sandra Lawrence and Karen Davidson, the Berkeley estate archivist, sifted through mouse skeletons, silverfish, dust, beetles and mould to uncover letters, documents, photographs, journals and receipts, transferring what they could salvage into bankers boxes.', 'They called it the ""Willmott tombola"", as they never knew what they would pull out.', '""I put my hand in once and found a 1771 letter from the Empress Maria Theresa,"" Sandra says. They dug out the remains of a 100-year-old chocolate bar and the first eight pages of a lost Purcell sonata, as well as an autograph book for thumb prints, known as a ""thumb-o-graph"".', 'Sandra set about cross-checking her findings with other sources such as old newspapers, journals, diaries and train tickets. She even made an appointments diary for Ellen to recreate her movements.', 'Sandra discovered Ellen was a much more ""nuanced individual"" than the stereotype would have us believe - someone who pushed at the boundaries imposed on women.', 'Ellen made it her ambition to join learned societies where previously only men had been allowed. The Linnean Society, described as ""the world\'s oldest active society devoted to natural history"", were blackballing women and Ellen became one of the first to join.', '""She was trying to get in with the big boys who\'d had public school education, who had been to university, who read Latin, who could understand science and were already masters in their field,"" says Sandra. Despite this, she thinks Ellen lacked confidence. ""I think she was dogged her whole life by thinking that she wasn\'t good enough and that somebody would find her out at some point.""', ""Sandra also thinks she knows why Ellen didn't show up to collect her prestigious RHS award."", 'Among the documents, Sandra and Karen found letters from a Miss Georgiana Tufnell, or ""Gian"". Gian had been one of Ellen\'s closest friends and worked as a lady-in-waiting to a member of the Royal Family, Princess Mary Adelaide. The letters from Gian suggest that she and Ellen had been deeply in love and were in a relationship together.', 'Gian first met Ellen in 1894 when she was 29 years old and Ellen was in her mid-thirties. Letters hint at the intimacy between the two. ""You couldn\'t love me as much as you do and not know something of what I feel,"" Gian writes. ', ""Sandra's research suggests that the women did not hide their affection. But after three years everything changed. "", ""The health of Gian's employer, Princess Mary, had been deteriorating throughout 1897 and her death would have left Gian in a financially unstable position. Sandra describes how, on 13 October, to the shock of everyone, especially Ellen, an announcement was made about Gian's engagement to the very wealthy - and elderly - Lord George Mount Stephen, who was 35 years older than his future wife."", 'The wedding was scheduled to take place on 27 October, the day after the RHS ceremony in which Ellen was meant to receive her prestigious award. Sandra feels that if Ellen had been in London at the time, she would not have been able to avoid going to the wedding - and so she ran away to her property in France instead. ', '""I think she had a broken heart,"" says Sandra.', ""At the very last minute, however, the wedding had to be postponed until November, due to Princess Mary's sudden death following an emergency operation."", ""But what of Ellen's reputation as the malicious saboteur - secretly scattering the seeds of her namesake plant, Miss Willmott's Ghost?"", '""Of course it\'s a myth,"" says Sandra - and a fairly recent one at that. ""It was only in 1980 [in a biography] that we first hear that story about her seed-bombing people\'s gardens - and it\'s a very handy one because it works as a really good metaphor for a prickly personality.""', 'Besides, Sandra says she has never been able to get Miss Willmott\'s Ghost to take seed. ""So it\'s not a very successful plant to seed bomb."" ', 'The story of how the plant became associated with Miss Willmott in the first place also remains somewhat of a mystery, says Sandra. ""Back in 1966 a garden writer called Graham Stuart Thomas asked in a journal, \'Where did [the name of this plant] come from?\' Nobody knew, and he got no replies."" ', ""However, says Sandra, Ellen's pistol-wielding reputation is deserved. "", '""She carried a revolver in her handbag and I found a knuckle duster, but that\'s not necessarily for the reasons we might think.""', 'When Sandra first found the knuckle duster among Ellen\'s possessions, she burst out laughing. ""I had this idea of this 70-year-old woman who was spoiling for a fight, but I think she carried those things because she was scared.""', 'In later life, at the end of the 1920s, Ellen had run out of money, ""mainly because she spent it all"", says Sandra. ', 'Since she could no longer afford a car, Ellen had to travel by train and Sandra believes she carried the weapons for protection when walking to the station along a remote country lane. ', 'There are still more Willmott archives to process. In the end, Sandra hopes that Ellen - often omitted from the lists of gardening greats - will be judged more kindly and realistically.', '""She was seminal in horticulture. I think her reputation now should be one of a human being that had huge amounts going for her."" We should accept, says Sandra, ""that none of us is perfect"".', ""Warley Place is now a 25-acre nature reserve maintained by Essex Wildlife Trust.

Long Reads,3,180.0,www.bbc.com,0.447129487991333,Long Reads,An unprecedented real-time war crimes investigation is testing Ukraine's local prosecutors.,Ukraine's prosecutors wrestle with a new role: war crimes investigators,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61749877,"['Denys Zboroshenko contributed to this report.', ['It took Vadym Bobryntsev four days to bury his wife, he said. It was the middle of March in Mala Rohan, a village near Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, and the ground was frozen. The village was under occupation by the Russian army, so Vadym went out periodically from their shell-damaged house to dig in a far corner of the garden shaded by apricot and quince trees. After 45 years of marriage, 69-year-old Vadym, alone, lifted his wife Iryna into a makeshift casket, folded her hands over her chest, lowered her into the grave, covered the casket with a corrugated tin sheet, to protect her, and filled in her grave with earth.', ""Two and a half months later, in early June, a local prosecutor from the city of Kharkiv drove out to Mala Rohan with a small team to dig Iryna up. First, the team walked around and through the remains of Vadym's house, interviewing him and taking pictures of the place where the shell had hit. After the inspection of the house, Vadym led the prosecutor along a path through the garden to the grave. The team took photographs, soil samples, and detailed notes, and watched attentively as two volunteers began to dig. Now the sun was beating down on Mala Rohan and the earth came loose easily. When the casket was raised up and ready to be opened, Vadym, holding a picture of his wife pressed between his palms, ducked under the branches of the apricot tree and walked toward the house so he would not see."", 'The local prosecutor, Maksym Klymovets, was at Vadym\'s house to help determine whether the Bobryntsevs were the victims of a war crime - a specialist field in which Klymovets and his colleagues had no experience until Russia invaded Ukraine, three months ago. Klymovets, who has cropped dark hair and a neatly-trimmed beard, was accompanied by two forensic police officers, another officer who took notes, two civilian witnesses drawn from the village - in accordance with Ukrainian law - and two local volunteers to dig the grave. ""This is totally new work for us,"" Klymovets said. ""We are learning on the job.""', ""After about three hours, Klymovets declared the evidence-gathering complete for this visit and Iryna's casket was loaded into the back of a van to be transported to the morgue. Her death would be recorded as an alleged war crime - one of nearly 16,000 such cases now open across the country, including more than 1,000 in the Kharkiv region. "", 'There is no precedent for what is happening now in Ukraine - a large-scale war crimes investigation being conducted as the war is going on, by the nation under attack. In Kharkiv, ordinary local prosecutors have found themselves thrust into complex investigations for which they have little or no experience. In the field, they wear vests, some hand-painted, which say ""War Crimes Prosecutor"", though this job does not technically exist. They are working tirelessly to examine and catalogue scenes of shellings, missile strikes, and murders, and sometimes scenes of brutal crimes against their countrymen.', ""The work is slow and methodical. Klymovets' team analysed the scene in Mala Rohan carefully, and they will return. Back in the city, in an apartment completely wrecked by a shell, another team measured and photographed every piece of damage, down to a small piece of glass embedded in a door. On the outskirts of a different village, yet another team went classroom to classroom in an agricultural college, tracing the path of a shell that had smashed through each dividing wall without exploding. As they go, the prosecutors narrate their observations in fine detail for the benefit of a video camera. They are following freshly-issued guidelines, and they work with the attentive diligence of people who are new to a task."", 'The Ukrainians are being supported by some international expertise - explosives technicians from Slovakia; forensics experts from France; war crimes experts from the UK; a 42-member team from the International Criminal Court. But the sheer number of war crimes investigations now open means the vast majority are being carried out by Ukrainian teams. In Kharkiv, before the invasion, there were only 23 people qualified to investigate war crimes, so the region had no choice but to delegate the power to ordinary prosecutors. ""Everyone is involved to the maximum,"" Klymovets said. ""We are working seven days a week."" ', 'But running war crimes investigations during a war presents significant difficulties. There are complex criteria which have to be determined to assess whether a war crime has been committed. The death of a civilian or destruction of a residential building alone is not proof. Were there Ukrainian military present at the site or nearby? Was the intention to strike a civilian target or was it a mistake? Was it definitely a Russian shell that fell on this building? ', 'Obtaining accurate information about Ukrainian military movements can be difficult, because members of the public are often reluctant to say anything, even to prosecutors, about the locations of Ukrainian troops. The prosecutors try to check with the military, ""but we cannot guarantee they will tell us the truth,"" said Oleksandr Filchakov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor\'s Office, ""because there is a war on after all."" Intentionality can be fiendishly difficult to prove, even with the best resources at your disposal. Satellite imagery can assist with determining where a rocket or artillery strike originated, but Ukrainian prosecutors have been unable to access it, because the priority is to use it for military purposes, because there is a war on. ', 'So all strikes on residential buildings and those that resulted in the deaths of civilians are all being recorded as alleged war crimes, under Article 438 of the Ukrainian criminal code. ""To be a lawful strike it has to be on a military facility, military unit or some other military object,"" said Serhiy Shevtsov, a local prosecutor in the Kyivskyi district of Kharkiv, as he examined an apartment building in his district that had been hit by a shell. ""If it\'s a residential block, then it does not matter even if there were military in there until a few days before,"" he said, ""it is Article 438.""', 'This is the prevailing view. But there is concern among some prosecutors and observers that the rush to investigate, while country is still at war, and to brand all these cases initially as war crimes, could undermine a broader future effort to hold Russia accountable. ', '""It is absolutely fine to be talking about potential war crimes, but the moment you set things in stone you make it easier for the other side to discredit your work,"" said Philippe Sands, a UCL law professor who has served at the UN International Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights. ""If you get to a court of law and you can\'t prove what you said happened, you have only created new problems,"" he said.', 'One regional prosecutor concerned with the process is Denys Masliy, the deputy head of the criminal supervisory department, who said he feared there was a resistance setting in to characterising strikes against apparent civilian targets as anything other than a war crime. ', '""Any prosecutor, any judge in Ukraine, in this environment, who would examine the details of Russian actions and rule they were lawful, he would look like a betrayer,"" Masliy said, standing under the ruins of a block of flats in central Kharkiv. ""As a prosecutor, I must be honest, but this could be perceived as if I am not acting for Ukraine,"" he said.', 'Masliy, a tall, good-humoured prosecutor with 24 years on the job, is something of a lone voice among his colleagues. ""No one wants to talk about this, it is not a popular topic of conversation,"" he said. ""But after this is all over, someone really impartial could take a deep look at all these cases and find problems. They will say we are fraudsters, our work is fake and we are the same as the Russians. The Russians will use it against us.""', ""Part of the problem stems from a genuine grey area around what constitutes a war crime. A week before the invasion, the regional prosecutors took an online training course on the issue. Masliy posed a scenario to the trainers from the prosecutor general's office: if he took his personal rifle and fired from his window at a Russian tank, and in response the Russians flattened his building, would it be a war crime? "", '""One of the trainers said, you have a right to shoot because they are invaders,"" said Masliy. ""The other guy said it could be considered a provocation, but he asked, is the danger from my rifle significant enough to justify blasting the whole block of flats? And they ended up having a quarrel with each other.""', 'Three months on from the training session, that hypothetical scenario has become a grim reality. Russia has flattened blocks of flats - with less provocation than a rifle shot - and much worse. The liberated suburbs west of Kyiv revealed execution-style killings and reports of brutal sexual violence. The horrors of Mariupol are yet to be fully discovered. ""It looks clear that war crimes are being committed and it looks like they are widespread and systematic,"" said Sands, the UCL law professor. ', ""The chances of justice ever being served for those crimes, at the higher levels of the Russian army and political system, are remote. The key task now, said Sands, was to gather evidence in the most rigorous way possible. And the key challenge facing Ukraine's newly-minted regional war crimes prosecutors, and its politicians, he said, was to show caution and restraint."", '""It is very difficult to show restraint in a time of war, and the people investigating are doing tremendous work, but I would urge real cool-headedness in the characterisation of what is being found and how it is being publicised,"" he said.', ""The shelling of Vadym Bobryntsev's house in Mala Rohan, and the death of his wife, was recorded as a war crime, but expert analysis will have to be brought to bear on the case - on small shell fragments from the scene, the likely trajectory of the projectile, on troop movements in the area - before the truth can be established. When that expertise is available is an unknown - there is a severe shortage against the vast number of cases."", 'When the shell hit the house, the village was occupied by the Russians, raising a question over whether the Russian army would have been shelling its own positions, two weeks into its occupation. This was the prosecutor\'s initial conclusion - Russian on Russian shelling - but it is possible Klymovets could have to contemplate reclassifying the case under a different legal statute if the evidence suggests it was a Ukrainian shell. ""Of course, if we discover that this was done by our military, we will re-classify it,"" he said.', 'To Vadym and Iryna Bobaryntsev\'s son, Pavlo, the important thing was to have ""an objective investigation, objective truth,"" he said. ""Truth must always prevail. This is a job that, although not very pleasant, helps to find the truth.""', 'In some cases, for some relatives, the objective truth could mean a verdict that the strike that killed their innocent loved one was lawful, under the rules of war. Pavlo stood alone by his father\'s vegetable patch, after his mother\'s casket had been loaded into the van, holding the picture of her he had found among the ruins of the house. ""She gave life to me, helped me to solve many problems, treated me with understanding,"" he said. ""How could this not be a crime?""']]","(['Legal profession', 'Long Reads', 'Russia-Ukraine war'],)","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/225A/production/_125349780_dsc01141-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1C10/production/_125348170_dsc00416-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17768/production/_125340169_dsc00705-nc.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10AD0/production/_125340386_dsc00506-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CD7C/production/_125340625_dsc0085-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/169BC/production/_125340629_dsc00974-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8344/production/_125340633_dsc00470-2.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png",Text and photographs by Joel Gunter,2022-06-11 00:53:56+00:00

Most practices in England are privately owned by GP partners, but a rule-change in 2007 allowed bigger companies to buy up partner-led surgeries. "", ['Operose Health has grown rapidly in recent years - it has spent millions buying GP practices. It now runs 70 surgeries with nearly 600,000 patients, making it the biggest GP provider to the NHS. ', 'Across the UK, there is a shortage of GPs and general practice is under unprecedented pressure. Former Operose employees who spoke to Panorama - a dozen doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other staff - said they believed patient safety was being put at risk. ', ' the company let less qualified staff see patients, rather than doctors, without adequate supervision.', 'Operose denies profit is being prioritised ahead of patient care and says it has a clear process of supervision. ', 'This is the diary of my time working in a busy Operose GP practice in London.', ""It's my second shift at the practice and already I'm dealing with a serious complaint. A patient came in and told me his GP had been absent and unreachable through his struggles with mental health. Last year, he had spoken to his GP but after this appointment he hadn't had any engagement from the practice. "", ""He said he hadn't been able to get his new prescription, or to create a mental health plan with his GP. The patient said he felt completely abandoned. "", 'The other receptionists are telling me this practice ""runs on locums"", meaning a lot of the GPs who work here are like freelancers - only working a shift here or there. ', 'Today I met one of the less-qualified clinicians known as a physician associate (PA). I could only speak to her for a few minutes as she rushed to her next appointment, but she quickly opened up about how she felt she was being treated exactly like a GP. ', 'She appeared stressed, telling me that from day one on the job she had been thrown in as if she had the experience of a GP, despite this being her first job out of training.  ', ""I hadn't heard of a PA before this. I asked my manager and they told me they were like GPs but couldn't prescribe. I asked why we wouldn't just have more doctors and my managers told me that each PA cost less than half that of a GP and were therefore cheaper."", ""At the practice where I'm working, there is a team of people who process documents for about 30 Operose GP practices. While it's common in GP practices for non-medical staff to deal with reports, test results and hospital letters, this team doesn't have easy access to a doctor if they have questions. They have to decide on their own which documents should be filed away and which require action by a GP or pharmacist. "", ""Staff in the central admin team say they're sometimes being told to process complex medical documents. They tell me they're concerned they'll make mistakes, but that management tell them to hit their targets. "", ""They tell me they skim-read, even if they don't understand the information they are looking at. This team is the first point where these documents are read and, if something is missed, it could mean delaying or risking vital patient care. "", ""I've managed to get a bit of time with one of the regular locum GPs at the practice. I ask about the PAs. He tells me PAs aren't the same as GPs and they actually need help and supervision. "", 'The doctor tells me it\'s an issue at the practice and that he had asked for time out of his daily shifts to talk through cases and support the PAs\' official supervisor, known as the clinical lead. He says this was refused by management in the interest of ""squeezing"" the most appointments for patients as possible.  ', ""Today a patient came in and complained that he was never able to see his named GP, who was also the GP director. As I began to explain that this doctor doesn't come into the practice, that I had never seen him and that other staff had told me that he comes in rarely, I was swept away from the front desk. "", 'One of the other receptionists told me never to tell patients that this doctor isn\'t at the practice or available to patients. I went to tell the practice manager of my ""mistake"". I was told that this doctor was ""always here"" - available by phone, despite not being physically present in the practice.  ', ""Today there wasn't a doctor or physician associate at the practice able to deal with patients with appointments. My co-workers and I panicked. We saw calls piling up - from 40 at 08:00, to dozens more soon after. "", ""One of the receptionists yelled from the back asking why there weren't any doctors. My colleague next to me said it was a joke and we shouldn't be open. "", ""Unusually, we were told we could book some patients in for the following day. But that had a knock-on effect. With the following day's appointments now already booked, it meant people calling from 08:00 the next morning, expecting to get an appointment, were also disappointed. We could only tell them try again the next day. "", ""We didn't have a single day this week with more than two full-time doctors available for appointments for a practice with 20,000 patients. I noticed that the same patients were calling up every day, sometimes several times, becoming more desperate for any solution. "", 'I once again had to tell them to try again at 08:00 the next day. All GP practices are under pressure, but NHS data shows that at my surgery there are about half the number of full-time equivalent doctors as there are at an average NHS surgery of this size.  ', 'Every morning we receptionists - as the first point of contact at the practice - had to endure hours of patients taking out their frustrations on us. Nothing could have prepared me for turning away patients. I believe much of it could have been solved if we just had a few more doctors.  ', ""I was told by workers from the central admin team, who process medical documents for about 30 Operose surgeries, that there was a backlog of more than 1,000 documents needing doctors' attention. They tell me that the paperwork has been flagged for action on the computer system, but have yet to be seen by a doctor or pharmacist. "", 'The documents are sent electronically to local practices, but the central team can still see which requests have not been actioned. I was told some of the correspondence had been waiting to be seen for six months.', 'Staff told me these were important documents - including diagnoses, prescription changes and urgent information GPs needed to be aware of.  ', ""The admin team told me they were concerned for the safety of patients. They showed me an example, a request to change the medication for a patient. It hadn't been looked at for five months, meaning that the patient could have been on the wrong medication."", 'As I took the morning calls, I felt relieved it was my last time having to answer the phone to frustrated patients. But I felt I was also abandoning them, as I wanted to try my best to help them when I could.

Among the ruins, a few residents are trying to survive.","In a ghost town of war, survivors eke out an existence",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61856229,"['Saltivka, in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, has been relentlessly bombarded by the Russians. Among the ruins, a few residents are trying to survive.', [""When Russian shells began raining down on Saltivka in February, life in the neighbourhood's numbered apartment blocks became a lottery - one block hit, the next spared. Inside each building, the residents of each apartment survived by their own luck - one apartment turned to ash, the next untouched. "", ""As the bombardment of Kharkiv went on - March, April, May, June - fewer and fewer buildings in Saltivka were spared. Now the neighbourhood is a ghost town. Everywhere you look, deathly black burn marks rise up from the windows where shells hit. There are multi-storey gashes in the sides of the buildings. There are neat circular holes in the roofs where shells punched through but didn't detonate. There are personal possessions strewn over the pathways between the buildings - ejected from the flats above with terrible force. And the shells are still falling."", 'When they land they shake the ground and send a boom bouncing off the buildings and echoing across the empty green spaces and playgrounds. The different shells and rockets have distinctive sounds and leave distinctive pieces of shrapnel that locals have become adept at recognising. They include ', ' and unguided rockets. None of the weapons are precisely targeted, so nowhere in the neighbourhood is safe.', 'When there is no shelling, Saltivka falls silent. ""Saltivka is like Chernobyl now,"" said Serhiy Khrystych, 44, as he washed his face with water from a plastic bottle, in building 80. ""Of course there was the radiation in Chernobyl, but it was not destroyed. We do not have the radiation but everything here is destroyed,"" he said. ""It is impossible to live.""', ""Yet there are people living here, eking out an existence in buildings with no gas or water, in some places just one or two residents in a block of 60 or more flats. The electricity has been switched back on in some buildings in the past week, and a few people have returned from the metro stations or other shelters. But it is still a tiny fraction of Saltivka's pre-war population. "", ""At its height, the neighbourhood - a Soviet era development for the city's industrial workers and their families - was home to somewhere between 500,000 and 800,000 people. It was full of family life."", '""It was a beautiful area, there was a beautiful park and there was light in the park, and benches and a fountain,"" said Tamara Koneva, a 70-year-old pensioner living on the ground floor of a half-destroyed building. ""Now there is nothing left,"" she said. ', 'Tamara\'s husband died in March, a month after the invasion. ""Because of the stress,"" she said. So she is mostly alone in their apartment, and nearly alone in the building. ""I miss him,"" she said. ""I don\'t even have the desire to go outside.""', ""There is one other person in Tamara's part of the building - a 53-year-old car mechanic called Valeriy Ivanovych, who has lived here for 20 years. His flat has been spared, so far, save for small pieces of shrapnel that broke his windows and punctured his washing machine, kitchen cupboard and bedroom wall like bullets. "", '""Barely anybody lives in this building anymore, there is only one couple, a man, a woman and me,"" Valeriy said. ""People sometimes come to collect belongings but they don\'t stay.""', ""The flats on Tamara and Valeriy's side of the stairwell were relatively undamaged, but a shell hit the other side directly and the apartment opposite Valeriy's was only ash, collapsed concrete and charred possessions. "", '""Maybe the building will have to be destroyed, because the second part of it is destroyed and the third part is very much destroyed,"" Valeriy said. ', 'He has no work now and nowhere else to go. He shrugged. ""This is my home, I have lived here all my life,"" he said, staring out his kitchen window over the trees. ', '""It will be a great sadness if all these houses are destroyed because I am very used to this place.""', 'With no utilities available in their apartments, some of the residents still living in Saltivka have created makeshift outdoor kitchens where they cook food and sit together for company. Once a day, volunteers from the food charity World Central Kitchen make their way around the neighbourhood and hand out meals in styrofoam boxes. ', '""Saltivka is a desert now,"" said Leon Petrosyan, a 50-year-old engineer who was carefully navigating a beaten-up black Volga around shell craters and debris, in order to hand out the food. ""The people who are left here have nowhere else to go,"" he said. ""They are trapped.""', 'Leon stopped for a break and lit a cigarette. The food deliveries are a lifeline for the few residents in Saltivka. There are no shops open here now and for many it is the only meal they eat each day.', 'Serhiy Zhuravliov, a 51-year-old, lifelong Saltivka resident who was helping deliver the food, said he had stayed in the neighbourhood throughout the invasion and the worst of fighting nearby, when Ukrainian troops were stationed in the residential buildings and the frontline was on the doorstep.', '""At first we felt fear. Later, we got used to the sound of the shelling,"" he said. ""Now we can\'t go to sleep without it.""', 'Looming over Leon and Serhiy as they smoked was a 16-storey tower gouged and burned by direct hits. Up on the 16th floor, Larisa Enina looked out carefully from her hallway on to the high open air, through a gap where part of the wall used to be.', 'There were about 15 people left in the 143-apartment building, Larisa said. The apartment she shares with her husband and daughter was relatively undamaged, save for shrapnel holes in the windows. ""The apartment near ours burned down completely and ours remained intact,"" she said. ""It is a miracle.""', 'But Larisa was worried about something else. There were big cracks in the walls on the 11th floor, she said, and she thought the building could collapse. ""It is a risk even to stand on the balcony now,"" she said.', ""It's also a risk to stand below. The shell hits dislodge slabs of concrete the size of cars from the top floors that slam into the pavements below with terrifying force. If you look up from the ground, you can see slabs that have been loosened but not fallen, and they sit precariously above the remaining residents."", 'Directly outside the entrance to one building, a massive slab had gone through four feet of pavement and earth and smashed a thick water pipe below. Roman Grynchenko, a 48-year-old car mechanic who has lived in Saltivka for 20 years, was stepping around the water-filled crater as he went in and out of the building.', 'Roman eats one free meal a day now and, like most people here, gets by on government assistance - £55 per month for him, £55 for his wife, and £83 for their daughter.  ', '""I\'ve been living here for 20 years,"" Roman said. ""Saltivka was a peaceful district ...""', 'A deafening crack cut him off - the first of three shells landing nearby.', '""Now there is a war,"" he said. ""You hear explosions."" ', 'The Russians attempted to seize Kharkiv in the early days of the invasion and Saltivka bore the brunt of the assault. The invaders were eventually pushed back, and the frontline now sits about 12 miles from the city centre. But Saltivka remains well within Russian artillery range, a reality made impossible to ignore by the daily shelling.', 'At the edge of the neighbourhood, there are still trenches where the Ukrainians dug in for the defence of the city, and chewed curbstones where their tanks mounted the pavements. They used the residential buildings for rest and for sniper positions, residents said - turning the neighbourhood into a target.', 'Few residents seemed to begrudge their presence. The soldiers went from building to building at the beginning asking those with children to evacuate, said Claudia Chubata, a 65-year-old resident of 33 years. ', '""They are our soldiers,"" she said. ""They needed to do something here for the war and they needed somewhere to rest.""', 'But Kharkiv is just 20 miles from the Russian border, a traditionally Russian-leaning, Russian-speaking city, and there are pockets of sympathy towards the invaders.', '""Where there is no Ukrainian military, the Russians do not shoot,"" said Boris Rustenko, a 63-year-old glass miller, born in the Soviet Union, whose building was badly damaged and burned.', '""If Russia had not attacked Ukraine, Ukraine would have attacked Russia, Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk,"" Boris said. ""It is very simple, Russia is just ahead.""', 'Boris, like many residents of Saltivka, has relatives in Russia. In cities like Kharkiv, the Russian-backed violence that began in 2014 and the recent invasion have created smaller conflicts among family and friends. ', '""This is Russia, we were brothers,"" said Oleksiy, a 69-year-old builder, who didn\'t want to give his last name. ""We don\'t understand why they invaded. We have relatives there, and now what?""', 'Russia alone was not to blame, Oleksiy thought. The West should ""stop giving Ukraine weapons"", he said, because it was only prolonging the war.', 'As Oleksiy was talking, another resident standing next to him started to cry. ""We were so happy to have flats here,"" said Halyna, a 62-year-old pensioner. Her windows, directly above where she stood, were smashed. ""We were told to replace them ourselves,"" she said. The repairs would cost five times her monthly pension.', 'Less than 10 miles away from where Halyna stood was the frontline. There are fears that Russian troops might return to Kharkiv. Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine\'s interior minister, said on Sunday that Russia was once again ""trying to make Kharkiv a frontline city"".', ""Outside Halyna's building, a few neighbours from buildings nearby were coming up to collect their daily free meal from a bench. It was late afternoon. Halyna looked on, a tear still under her eye. "", '""How many have been killed now?"" she said, shaking her head. ', '""And just boys, 18 years old.

He is not happy with the prospect of the amount of housing tripling.', '""Something has to happen. If the vote was \'no\' what would that mean?

There is a community drop-in called The Dovetail, inside which is a model of the plans for the estate. There are yoga sessions, art classes and other activities. Updates on the plans and messages from the mayor are posted on a bright and cheerful website and in a regular newsletter."", 'Will these plans survive the upcoming upheaval? The viability of building affordable housing tends to depend on how much cash can be raised from building homes for private sale on a development site. ', 'That income subsidises the affordability, enabling more flats at social rent.', 'The question is how the council makes the sums add up - and how long this drags out the regeneration.', 'The local authority has set up its own housing company to deliver the project, which will be exposed to the same risks as any developer: economic downturn, rising inflation and interest rates, spiralling energy costs.', 'Advice in council papers is clear that the initial pledges on timescale, design and the mix of tenure could change.', 'Nothing is set in stone.', 'Mr Lubin has just learned, via a newsletter, that refurbishment of Lund Point will not be completed until 2026.', 'Work is due to start this autumn, with the refurbishment of James Riley Point.', 'Over the past few years, the cost of renewing this one block has been steadily rising. It is now estimated at £35m.', 'Another big impediment for the council is four families, leaseholders who still live in the block. They will need to be bought out - and moved out - before the renovation can start.', 'For well over a decade, they have been the only occupants in a block of 130 flats.', 'Some children have spent all their lives calling this home.', 'Now they are feeling the pressure to move - with the progress of the whole redevelopment laid at their door.', 'Negotiations are taking place to try to avert compulsory purchases, which would be even more costly and time consuming.', 'There is now only one shop on the estate, next door to The Dovetail, the centre of community engagement. The proprietors do not know when to expect demolition, or whether they will be offered new premises.', 'With footfall so greatly reduced, business has been poor over the past, lost decade. ', 'But an unlikely saviour has emerged, clad in claret and blue: West Ham United fans.', 'They stream through the estate on their way to matches at the London Stadium, which the club now leases, stopping for drinks and snacks. ', 'It is an economic upside to weigh against the complaints of some residents that fans urinate in their gardens.', ""The Carpenters Arms, as the pub closest to the stadium, is now very much a Hammers' local, packed out on match days."", ""West Ham's prolonged run in the Europa League, reaching the semi-final, meant extra paydays - but landlady Pauline Clarke is another who has no idea how long she's got here."", 'Hours before each match she and her staff erect fencing around the pub, and there is a heavy presence of security guards to prevent trouble with rival fans.', 'The state of paralysis which has gripped the Carpenters Estate has made it a curiosity for academics.

', 'Originally, 9,000 homes were to be built on the former Olympic Park, half of them affordable for local people. ', 'But fewer than 200 new homes built are offered at the cheapest levels of rent. ', 'A decade on from the Games, which cost £9bn to host, about 1,200 homes have been built on the site, most of which, it is claimed, are unattainable for many people in the area. ', 'The planning authority responsible for development on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and surrounding areas, the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), said affordable housing targets had changed with different mayoralties. It also said many political decisions on housing provision in the area pre-dated its formation.', 'The promises have ""melted away"", said Nick Sharman, who until recently sat on the LLDC\'s planning committee. ""They have been betrayed, no question about it.""', 'In 2005, ""the deal was very clear"" when London\'s first directly elected mayor Ken Livingstone championed the Olympics coming to the capital, said Mr Sharman, who was at the time in charge of regeneration at the London Development Agency.  ', '""He [Mr Livingstone] said: \'This is going to be the regeneration Olympics\' - in other words, it\'s going to have a real legacy for the people of east London."" ', 'The official bid to host the Games, which was led by London 2012 chair Lord Coe, said that ""the most enduring legacy of the Olympics will be the regeneration of an entire community for the direct benefit of everyone who lives there"". ', 'At the time, the area had some of the most deprived council wards in England.', ""At the heart of Mr Livingstone's legacy pledge was that 50% of any housing built would be affordable, said Mr Sharman. "", 'Mr Sharman added that it was ""those commitments that really inspired the enthusiasm, I think, of the Olympic Committee, but certainly the wider population"".', 'Mr Livingstone told the BBC that had he not lost the London mayoralty to Boris Johnson, he would have ensured the 50% affordable housing pledge was kept.', 'Ten years after the Games, the former Olympic Park in Stratford and its surroundings are the focus of a vast regeneration programme, led by the LLDC. ', '""Instead of being the diverse community that Ken Livingstone promised, a model of social inclusion, we\'re getting the exact reverse,"" said Mr Sharman.', 'On the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, where many of the events were held in 2012, just under 1,200 homes have been built. Only 37% of these are officially classed as affordable, rather than the promised 50%.', 'Chobham Manor, a development of 880 homes next to the Lee Valley Velo Park, is an ""incredible new neighbourhood"", according to developer Taylor Wimpey.  ', 'It includes 169 social and affordable rent (low-cost) homes. However, a third of units classed as affordable are offered as shared-ownership properties. This is a scheme that aims to make it ""possible for first-time buyers and families to get on to the property ladder"", according to the housing association managing the homes.', 'Recently, 25% shares in two and three-bedroom flats were advertised. These homes required a minimum income of £69,000 a year to buy - well over twice the £29,000 median annual salary for residents of Newham.', 'Of the homes currently on the park under the banner of ""affordable"", 57% are ""intermediate"" - either offered as shared ownership, or for rent at about 75% of the market rate. ', 'However, according to masterplan for the park in 2011, only 40% of the affordable housing stock should have been intermediate, while 60% was supposed to have been made up of social or low-cost rental homes. ', 'It\'s ""gentrification"", says Rudy Smith, who has spent much of her life in Newham. She and her three-year-old son are among the 33,000 households on the council\'s housing list. ', '""It looks like we\'re generating wealth, helping the community, but actually you\'re not helping the community. ', '""It\'s a façade,"" added Ms Smith, who with her son is among about 5,700 families that have been placed in temporary accommodation by Newham Council. ', 'They live in a ""tiny"" flat in which they share a bed, she said.  ', '""It\'s not even suitable for me if I was a single person, let alone as someone with a child."" ', 'Rudy says she is worried the council might only be able to offer her a permanent home away from the area. ', '""I know someone personally, they\'ve had to move to Clacton-on-Sea. Her family is in Newham and partly in Hackney. She\'s the only one down there in Clacton-on-Sea, you know, so it\'s a reality for some people and I hope it doesn\'t have to be an actual reality for me."" ', ""Like Ms Smith, Godfrey Muhoozi, a father of two from Stratford, cannot afford to rent a home privately. He says he has been on Newham Council's housing list for four years. "", '""It\'s a nightmare,"" he said. His family currently lives in a two-bedroom flat, with his teenage daughter and teenage son sharing a bedroom. ', '""It\'s not good, them being the age they are, especially for my daughter.', '""I thought about trying to set up a partition in the room so they have some privacy, but even that is very expensive and I can\'t afford it."" ', 'Mr Muhoozi and Ms Smith are among 70,000 people on council housing lists across the four hosting boroughs of the 2012 Olympics  - Newham, Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Waltham Forest. ', '""It is really quite shocking,"" according to academic and east London housing expert Dr Penny Bernstock. She has interviewed families living in ""terrible"" conditions near the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.', '""It\'s the most extreme housing misery you can imagine - you know, people living in damp, miserable accommodation with a lack of light; children moving multiple times."" ', 'It was addressing the ""misery"" of historically impoverished east London that was central to the Olympic bid, Dr Bernstock said. ', '""We have built mainly market housing in an area of acute housing need. This is particularly problematic, given that addressing deprivation, including housing deprivation, was a key dimension of  London\'s bid.""', 'The concept of affordable housing on the former Olympic Park was always ""slippery"" in any case, according to Dr Bernstock.', '""We\'re building too many intermediate units and not enough social rented units. And so the people that are going to benefit are not going to be the average people living in the area, they\'re going to be wealthier people from outside.""', 'Dr Bernstock, who is from east London, said the former Olympic Park now has parallels with Canary Wharf, a financial and residential district in the historically deprived borough of Tower Hamlets.', '""You\'ve got this wealth in the middle and you\'ve got the poverty around, and that poverty scenario has not changed,"" she said. ', 'However, Dr Bernstock added that she believed there had been some recent improvements in terms of affordable housing provision on the park.', 'The LLDC said all such homes on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park had so far gone to local people. ', 'By 2035, a total of 5,426 homes are scheduled to have been built on the former Olympic Park, according to the LLDC, rather than the 9,000 originally proposed.  ', ""The residential ambitions were altered 2014, when plans were made for the East Bank quarter. This will see branches of the V&A museum, Sadler's Wells theatre, the BBC and the London College of Fashion arrive in Stratford in the coming years. The LLDC said it believed this would be of more long-term benefit to the area than additional homes."", 'However, according to Dr Bernstock, this approach ""compromised"" any affordable housing plans.  ', 'Instead of the 2,600 homes originally planned for one site on the park, 600 homes will be built, and the Stratford Waterfront development will consist only of shared-ownership flats. ', '""This is 0% affordable housing,"" said Dr Bernstock. A formal legal agreement on such housing as part of the legacy of the 2012 Olympics should have been made before the Games, she added. ', 'When all the housing schemes on the park have been completed, 40% will be classed as affordable, including a mixture of tenures, the LLDC said. ', ""The planning authority, set up by Boris Johnson when he was London's mayor to develop the area post-Olympics, has overseen the construction of about 11,500 new homes since 2012, including those in the park itself. Despite 2012 City Hall guidance that 40% of legacy homes should be affordable, the LLDC said only 24% of them were, with 12% being categorised as low-cost. "", 'The legacy scheme to deliver the most social housing so far is the East Village in Stratford. ', 'Triathlon Homes manages 675 social homes on the site, which originally housed Olympic athletes and was later converted into flats. A further 48 social homes are under construction there.', 'While this is welcomed, it should however be balanced against the previous loss of low-cost housing in the area, according to Dr Piero Corcillo, an urban regeneration expert at Birkbeck University, who completed a PhD on social mixing at East Village.', '""We also need to consider that in order to build the Olympic Park, a social housing estate, the Clays Lane Estate, was demolished and that provided 425 housing units,"" he said. ', 'Of the 3,800 homes on the site, the majority are offered at market-rate rent by property company Get Living, which says it ""looks to respond to the acute need for new homes in central London"".', 'Two-bedroom flats in the East Village can be rented out for upwards of £2,300 a month.', 'Built with public money, the site was to have been 50% affordable housing, according to plans drawn up several years before the Games. ', '""This hasn\'t been delivered,"" said Dr Corcillo, who added that ""there\'s no mechanism to bring decision-makers to account"". ', 'The development is not socially inclusive, he said, and is instead ""definitely geared towards the middle classes, and the better-off fraction of the working class"".', 'When the East Village development is complete, 30% of the homes will be affordable, according to Get Living, which says it has fulfilled its affordable housing obligations.', 'Elsewhere, large developments have sprung up in parts of Stratford such as Chobham Farm, as well as in Hackney Wick, Fish Island and Bromley-by-Bow. ', 'Mr Sharman, who was until recently a Hackney councillor, said he believed his area had been transformed into a ""middle-class barracks"". ', 'Many of the new homes are attracting affluent couples from outside the area, he said, adding: ""When they start having more than one child, almost certainly they will move out.', '""I think what comes hardest is that we put so much money into the Olympics, made it a great Games, a fantastically inclusive Games; the legacy of that money has been simply to benefit this narrow band of people. And it didn\'t have to be that way.""', 'Mr Sharman believes what has happened is a ""microcosm"" of a wider housing problem in the capital: ""The London housing market is not catering for Londoners."" ', 'The LLDC has to cope with a ""fatally flawed"" model, as it inherited the debt for hosting the Games, he believes. It has, Mr Sharman says, an ""impossible job"". ', '""They were charged with developing the area, and maximising the land value of it, in order to repay the loans and the subsidies,"" he said.', '""So they had two things that are in contradiction, and you can\'t be both gamekeeper and poacher.

', '""That was helpful for financial reasons, because theatre is not particularly well paid,"" said Mr Godfrey, who initially bought a 50% share in his flat, but has gradually increased that share to 100%. ', '""It meant I could live in London, it meant I could afford to have two bedrooms, which I needed for my family circumstances.
